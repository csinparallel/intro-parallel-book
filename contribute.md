## Information for Contributing Authors

If you are interested in contributing to *PDC For Beginners*, please 
reach out to CSinParallel at csinparallel@stolaf.edu. We are especially 
looking for volunteers to contribute a section on the following topics:

Sorting
Sieve of Eratosthenes
Matrix Multiplication

## Setting up the local authoring environment
To set up the local authoring environment, please complete the following steps:

## Installing Runestone

*PDC For Beginners* is built using the Runestone environment. While you don't 
need to understand the internals of Runestone, you will need a local instance 
of Runestone to preview your section. Please visit the [Runestone Quickstart 
Installation Guide](https://pypi.org/project/runestone/) for details. In 
general, it's recommended that you run Runestone in a virtual environment 
(like virtualenv). You will need at least Python 3.7 and pip (or pip3) 
installed on your system.

The following instructions should work on most Linux and OS X systems. If you 
have a Mac and are having trouble with the instructions below, check out 
an [alternative setup](mac_installation.md) put together by Dr. Suzanne Rivoire 
of Sonoma State University.

The following set of commands work for most users (taken from the Runestone 
Installation Guide): 

```
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv /path/to/home/MyEnv
$ source /path/to/home/MyEnv/bin/activate
```

Within the virtual environment, use `pip` (or `pip3`) to install runestone:

```
pip install runestone
```

Note that if you have separate instances of Python 2.* and Python 3.* on your
system, you may need to use `pip3` instead. 

## Fork the PDC For Beginners GitHub repository

Fork the *PDC For Beginners* GitHub repository by visiting 
[this link](https://github.com/csinparallel/intro-parallel-book) and 
clicking on the "Fork" icon in the top right-hand corner. 

Chapter content is added to the `_sources/` directory. For example, if you are 
a chapter 3 section author, your section will be located under 
`_sources/commonAlgorithms` as a separate .rst file.

## Writing content

*PDC for Beginners* is written using Runestone components and restructured 
text (reST). The following [cheat sheet](http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html)
is a useful guide for the different markup components needed to write a document 
using restructured text.

In addition to restructured text, runestone chapters contain Runestone 
Directives (see the 
[Runestone Author Guide](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/authorguide/index.html) 
for details). Runestone Directives allow the integration of many interactive 
content, such as videos, multiple choice questions, parson problems and others. 


The follow example illustrates how a particular section may be set up using 
restructured text and Runestone directives:

```
3.x This is a section heading
----------------------------------------

Section content would go here. Notice how the number of hyphens/dashes extend 
past the section heading. The number of hyphens must be at least as long as 
the section title itself.

Here is an example of **bold** text. Here is an example of *italicized* text. 
This (:math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`) is an example of an in-lined LaTeX math equation.

The following is an example of an standalone math equation:

.. math::
   
   \sum_{i=0}^n i \equiv \frac{n \times (n + 1}{2}



3.x.1: This is a subsection heading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Notice how the carats (^) must be at least as long as the subsection heading 
text. 

Here is an example of a URL: `CSinParallel <csinparallel.org>`_

Here is how a video may be included (from the Runestone documentation):

.. video:: video-ex1
   :controls:
   :thumb: /_images/whileloop.png

   http://media.interactivepython.org/thinkcsVideos/whileloop.mov

```

## Previewing your work

There are two main commands that an author needs to know in order to preview 
their work locally. 

### runestone build

Use the `runestone build` command to locally compile your changes. Most 
warnings can be ignored. If the project does not build for whatever reason, 
contact CSinParallel at csinparallel@stolaf.edu. 

### runestone serve

Use the `runestone serve` command to launch the server (typically at 
https://localhost:8000). We recommend having the local server open at at all 
times and having a separate window to do your compiling. You will need to 
reload your browser to see any new changes.

### Trouble shooting tips

Here are some helpful tips if you find yourself getting stuck

* If `runestone build` does not work, check your Runestone version. If it 
  is 5.6.0 or later, open up `conf.py` and ensure line 21 reads
  `from runestone import runestone_static_dirs, runestone_extensions, setup`
  (notice the addition of `, setup` at the end of the command). 


* Make sure that your runestone objects have unique keys. If you reuse keys, 
  there will be build errors. 

* The video format has to be in `mov` format for Runestone to interpret it. 
  Annoying, yes, but a tool like `ffmpeg` can automatically do the conversion 
  for you. A command like the following usually works (for mp4 to mov):
  `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -f mov video.mov`. If you don't have access to the 
  command line or having difficulties with ffmpeg, send a link to your mp4 
  video to csinparallel@stolaf.edu and we will convert it for you. 

## Merging changes back in

*PDC For Beginners* uses the [fork and pull model](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
for collaborative development. 

When you are ready to share your changes, please create a
[Git Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). 
GitHub also has specific documentation on how to [create a pull request from 
a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

After we review your work, it will be merged into the main branch of the 
repository. We will rebuild the book on our server soon after!
