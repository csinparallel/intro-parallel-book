8 The pale Usher--threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him
9 now.  He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
10 handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
11 known nations of the world.  He loved to dust his old grammars; it
12 somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

14 "While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what
15 name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue leaving out, through
16 ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh the signification
17 of the word, you deliver that which is not true." --HACKLUYT

42 EXTRACTS (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).
43 
44 It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
45 a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
46 Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
47 allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
48 sacred or profane.  Therefore you must not, in every case at least,
49 take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
50 these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology.  Far from it.  As
51 touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
52 appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as
53 affording a glancing bird's eye view of what has been promiscuously
54 said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and
55 generations, including our own.
56 
57 So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.
58 Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
59 world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too
60 rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
61 poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
62 bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
63 unpleasant sadness--Give it up, Sub-Subs!  For by how much the more
64 pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for
65 ever go thankless!  Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and
66 the Tuileries for ye!  But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
67 royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before
68 are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
69 long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
70 Here ye strike but splintered hearts together--there, ye shall strike
71 unsplinterable glasses!

203 "We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The

205 that is a fable. ...  They frequently climb up the masts to see
206 whether they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat
207 for his pains. ...  I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that
208 had above a barrel of herrings in his belly. ...  One of our

210 was white all over." --A VOYAGE TO GREENLAND, A.D. 1671 HARRIS COLL.

252 behind the whale, in order to avoid being seen by us." --COOK'S

254 
255 "The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack.  They stand in so
256 great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to

258 and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order

502 CHAPTER 1
503 
504 Loomings.
505 
506 
507 Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago--never mind how long
508 precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
509 particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
510 little and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of
511 driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.  Whenever I
512 find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
513 drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
514 pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
515 funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper
516 hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
517 from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
518 people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
519 as I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  With a
520 philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
521 take to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.  If they but
522 knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish
523 very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
524 
525 There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
526 wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with
527 her surf.  Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its
528 extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by
529 waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of
530 sight of land.  Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
531 
532 Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from
533 Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
534 northward.  What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around
535 the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean
536 reveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the
537 pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
538 high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better
539 seaward peep.  But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in
540 lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
541 desks.  How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they
542 here?
543 
544 But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
545 seemingly bound for a dive.  Strange!  Nothing will content them but
546 the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of
547 yonder warehouses will not suffice.  No.  They must get just as nigh
548 the water as they possibly can without falling in.  And there they
549 stand--miles of them--leagues.  Inlanders all, they come from lanes
550 and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.  Yet
551 here they all unite.  Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the
552 needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?
553 
554 Once more.  Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
555 Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down
556 in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.  There is
557 magic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his
558 deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,
559 and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all
560 that region.  Should you ever be athirst in the great American
561 desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied
562 with a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as every one knows, meditation
563 and water are wedded for ever.
564 
565 But here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
566 shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all
567 the valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?  There
568 stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a
569 crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his
570 cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.  Deep into
571 distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of
572 mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though the picture
573 lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs
574 like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the
575 shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.  Go visit
576 the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
577 knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm
578 wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara
579 but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see
580 it?  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two
581 handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he
582 sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway
583 Beach?  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy
584 soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your
585 first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical
586 vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of
587 sight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did
588 the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely
589 all this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of
590 that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the
591 tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and
592 was drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and
593 oceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this
594 is the key to it all.
595 
596 Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I
597 begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of
598 my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as
599 a passenger.  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,
600 and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides,
601 passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do
602 not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a
603 passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea
604 as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and
605 distinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I
606 abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations
607 of every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take
608 care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,
609 schooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess
610 there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer
611 on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though
612 once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and
613 peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to
614 say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the
615 idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted
616 river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their
617 huge bake-houses the pyramids.
618 
619 No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
620 plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
621 True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
622 spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of
623 thing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one's sense of honour,
624 particularly if you come of an old established family in the land,
625 the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than
626 all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have
627 been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys
628 stand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,
629 from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of
630 Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even
631 this wears off in time.
632 
633 What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a
634 broom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,
635 weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think
636 the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I
637 promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular
638 instance?  Who ain't a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the
639 old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch
640 me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;
641 that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same
642 way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and
643 so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each
644 other's shoulder-blades, and be content.
645 
646 Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
647 paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
648 penny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves
649 must pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between
650 paying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most
651 uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon
652 us.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity
653 with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering
654 that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly
655 ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how
656 cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
657 
658 Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
659 exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,
660 head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
661 you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
662 Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
663 the sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but
664 not so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in
665 many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect
666 it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea
667 as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a
668 whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who
669 has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and
670 influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than
671 any one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,
672 formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a
673 long time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo
674 between more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the
675 bill must have run something like this:
676 
677 
678 "GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
679 "WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.
680 "BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."
681 
682 
683 Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,
684 the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
685 others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and
686 short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in
687 farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I
688 recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the
689 springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under
690 various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,
691 besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting
692 from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.
693 
694 Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
695 whale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all
696 my curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his
697 island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,
698 with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and
699 sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such
700 things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented
701 with an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden
702 seas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am
703 quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would
704 they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all
705 the inmates of the place one lodges in.
706 
707 By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
708 great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
709 conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
710 my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of
711 them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
712 
713 
714 
715 CHAPTER 2
716 
717 The Carpet-Bag.
718 
719 
720 I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
721 arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good
722 city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a
723 Saturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning
724 that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no
725 way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.
726 
727 As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop
728 at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as
729 well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my
730 mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because
731 there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected
732 with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides
733 though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the
734 business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is
735 now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre
736 of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was
737 stranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal
738 whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the
739 Leviathan?  And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first
740 adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
741 cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to
742 discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
743 bowsprit?
744 
745 Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before
746 me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it
747 became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep
748 meanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and
749 dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the
750 place.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only
751 brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,
752 said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street
753 shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with
754 the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may
755 conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire
756 the price, and don't be too particular.
757 
758 With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of "The
759 Crossed Harpoons"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
760 Further on, from the bright red windows of the "Sword-Fish Inn,"
761 there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the
762 packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the
763 congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic
764 pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the
765 flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles
766 of my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and
767 jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare
768 in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.
769 But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away from
770 before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I
771 went.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,
772 for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.
773 
774 Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either
775 hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a
776 tomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that
777 quarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to
778 a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which
779 stood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant
780 for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was
781 to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! thought I, ha, as the
782 flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that
783 destroyed city, Gomorrah?  But "The Crossed Harpoons," and "The
784 Sword-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the sign of "The Trap."
785 However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed
786 on and opened a second, interior door.
787 
788 It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred
789 black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black
790 Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.  It was a negro church;
791 and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the
792 weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered
793 I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'
794 
795 Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
796 docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
797 swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
798 representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
799 underneath--"The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin."
800 
801 Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
802 thought I.  But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I
803 suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light
804 looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and
805 the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have
806 been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the
807 swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought
808 that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea
809 coffee.
810 
811 It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side
812 palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp
813 bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse
814 howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.  Euroclydon,
815 nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with
816 his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.  "In judging of that
817 tempestuous wind called Euroclydon," says an old writer--of whose
818 works I possess the only copy extant--"it maketh a marvellous
819 difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where
820 the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from
821 that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which
822 the wight Death is the only glazier."  True enough, thought I, as
823 this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest
824 well.  Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the
825 house.  What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies
826 though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it's too
827 late to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the
828 copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.
829 Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for
830 his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might
831 plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and
832 yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon!
833 says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one
834 afterwards) pooh, pooh!  What a fine frosty night; how Orion
835 glitters; what northern lights!  Let them talk of their oriental
836 summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of
837 making my own summer with my own coals.
838 
839 But what thinks Lazarus?  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them
840 up to the grand northern lights?  Would not Lazarus rather be in
841 Sumatra than here?  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise
842 along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit
843 itself, in order to keep out this frost?
844 
845 Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before
846 the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should
847 be moored to one of the Moluccas.  Yet Dives himself, he too lives
848 like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a
849 president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of
850 orphans.
851 
852 But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there
853 is plenty of that yet to come.  Let us scrape the ice from our
854 frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this "Spouter" may be.
855 
856 
857 
858 CHAPTER 3
859 
860 The Spouter-Inn.
861 
862 
863 Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
864 low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
865 the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very
866 large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,
867 that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only
868 by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and
869 careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an
870 understanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades
871 and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young
872 artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to
873 delineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest
874 contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by
875 throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at
876 last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might
877 not be altogether unwarranted.
878 
879 But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
880 portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
881 picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
882 nameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to
883 drive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
884 half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you
885 to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out
886 what that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon a bright, but,
887 alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It's the Black Sea in a
888 midnight gale.--It's the unnatural combat of the four primal
889 elements.--It's a blasted heath.--It's a Hyperborean winter
890 scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.  But at
891 last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in
892 the picture's midst.  THAT once found out, and all the rest were
893 plain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
894 fish? even the great leviathan himself?
895 
896 In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
897 partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
898 whom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents a
899 Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering
900 there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an
901 exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in
902 the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.
903 
904 The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
905 array of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with
906 glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
907 of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping
908 round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
909 mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous
910 cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such
911 a hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old
912 whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were
913 storied weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,
914 fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a
915 sunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was
916 flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards
917 slain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the
918 tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,
919 travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the
920 hump.
921 
922 Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut
923 through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
924 fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.  A still duskier
925 place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old
926 wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some
927 old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this
928 corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a
929 long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled
930 with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.
931 Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking
932 den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale's head.  Be that how it
933 may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a
934 coach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,
935 ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws
936 of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed
937 they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their
938 money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.
939 
940 Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.  Though
941 true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses
942 deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.  Parallel
943 meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads'
944 goblets.  Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS
945 a penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure,
946 which you may gulp down for a shilling.
947 
948 Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered
949 about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of
950 SKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be
951 accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was
952 full--not a bed unoccupied.  "But avast," he added, tapping his
953 forehead, "you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket,
954 have ye?  I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better get used
955 to that sort of thing."
956 
957 I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
958 ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and
959 that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
960 harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
961 further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up
962 with the half of any decent man's blanket.
963 
964 "I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?
965 Supper'll be ready directly."
966 
967 I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on
968 the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning
969 it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at
970 the space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under
971 full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.
972 
973 At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
974 adjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord
975 said he couldn't afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,
976 each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey
977 jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half
978 frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not
979 only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for
980 supper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to
981 these dumplings in a most direful manner.
982 
983 "My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead
984 sartainty."
985 
986 "Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"
987 
988 "Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the
989 harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he
990 don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."
991 
992 "The devil he does," says I.  "Where is that harpooneer?  Is he
993 here?"
994 
995 "He'll be here afore long," was the answer.
996 
997 I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this "dark
998 complexioned" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it
999 so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get
1000 into bed before I did.
1001 
1002 Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
1003 what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
1004 evening as a looker on.
1005 
1006 Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the
1007 landlord cried, "That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported in
1008 the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.
1009 Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees."
1010 
1011 A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
1012 open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in
1013 their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen
1014 comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with
1015 icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had
1016 just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they
1017 entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the
1018 whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there
1019 officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained
1020 of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like
1021 potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for
1022 all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,
1023 or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side
1024 of an ice-island.
1025 
1026 The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
1027 with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
1028 capering about most obstreperously.
1029 
1030 I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
1031 he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
1032 own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much
1033 noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the
1034 sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though
1035 but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),
1036 I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full
1037 six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a
1038 coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was
1039 deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the
1040 contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some
1041 reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at
1042 once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I
1043 thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
1044 Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions
1045 had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I
1046 saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few
1047 minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it
1048 seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry
1049 of "Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and darted out of
1050 the house in pursuit of him.
1051 
1052 It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost
1053 supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate
1054 myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to
1055 the entrance of the seamen.
1056 
1057 No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal
1058 rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but
1059 people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes
1060 to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange
1061 town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections
1062 indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a
1063 sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors
1064 no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To
1065 be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your
1066 own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in
1067 your own skin.
1068 
1069 The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
1070 thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a
1071 harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be
1072 of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all
1073 over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought
1074 to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon
1075 me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been
1076 coming?
1077 
1078 "Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't
1079 sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here."
1080 
1081 "Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a
1082 mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here"--feeling of the knots
1083 and notches.  "But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's
1084 plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough."
1085 So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief
1086 first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,
1087 the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;
1088 till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.
1089 The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for
1090 heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did
1091 not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a
1092 pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and
1093 throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went
1094 about his business, and left me in a brown study.
1095 
1096 I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
1097 short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too
1098 narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
1099 than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the
1100 first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
1101 leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.
1102 But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me
1103 from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at
1104 all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one
1105 from the window, and both together formed a series of small
1106 whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought
1107 to spend the night.
1108 
1109 The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I
1110 steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,
1111 not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad
1112 idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell
1113 but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the
1114 harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me
1115 down!
1116 
1117 Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
1118 spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I
1119 began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable
1120 prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait
1121 awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at
1122 him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after
1123 all--there's no telling.
1124 
1125 But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and
1126 threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
1127 
1128 "Landlord! said I, "what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep
1129 such late hours?"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.
1130 
1131 The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
1132 mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  "No," he
1133 answered, "generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to
1134 rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he
1135 went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him
1136 so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head."
1137 
1138 "Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
1139 are telling me?" getting into a towering rage.  "Do you pretend to
1140 say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
1141 Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around
1142 this town?"
1143 
1144 "That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't
1145 sell it here, the market's overstocked."
1146 
1147 "With what?" shouted I.
1148 
1149 "With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"
1150 
1151 "I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly, "you'd better
1152 stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green."
1153 
1154 "May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I
1155 rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a
1156 slanderin' his head."
1157 
1158 "I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at
1159 this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.
1160 
1161 "It's broke a'ready," said he.
1162 
1163 "Broke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"
1164 
1165 "Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."
1166 
1167 "Landlord," said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
1168 snow-storm--"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one
1169 another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a
1170 bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
1171 belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I
1172 have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
1173 exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
1174 towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of
1175 connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the
1176 highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and
1177 what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe
1178 to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so
1179 good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I
1180 take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've
1181 no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,
1182 landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would
1183 thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution."
1184 
1185 "Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath, "that's a purty
1186 long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,
1187 be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just
1188 arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New
1189 Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but
1190 one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's
1191 Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the
1192 streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,
1193 but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four
1194 heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions."
1195 
1196 This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and
1197 showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling
1198 me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who
1199 stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged
1200 in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
1201 
1202 "Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."
1203 
1204 "He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder.  "But come, it's getting
1205 dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;
1206 Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's
1207 plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty
1208 big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and
1209 little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling
1210 about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came
1211 near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come
1212 along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted
1213 a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I
1214 stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed
1215 "I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come
1216 to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"
1217 
1218 I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I
1219 was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure
1220 enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
1221 harpooneers to sleep abreast.
1222 
1223 "There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea
1224 chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; "there,
1225 make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye."  I turned
1226 round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
1227 
1228 Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of
1229 the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then
1230 glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
1231 could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude
1232 shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man
1233 striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,
1234 there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one
1235 corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's
1236 wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a
1237 parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the
1238 fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
1239 
1240 But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to
1241 the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to
1242 arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare
1243 it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with
1244 little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills
1245 round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of
1246 this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could
1247 it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,
1248 and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?
1249 I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being
1250 uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though
1251 this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I
1252 went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never
1253 saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry
1254 that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
1255 
1256 I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
1257 head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time
1258 on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then
1259 stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,
1260 and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel
1261 very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the
1262 landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that
1263 night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of
1264 my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into
1265 bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
1266 
1267 Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
1268 there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not
1269 sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had
1270 pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I
1271 heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light
1272 come into the room from under the door.
1273 
1274 Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
1275 head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a
1276 word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical
1277 New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and
1278 without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off
1279 from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at
1280 the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the
1281 room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted
1282 for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This
1283 accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a
1284 sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here
1285 and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's
1286 just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,
1287 got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at
1288 that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I
1289 plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black
1290 squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At
1291 first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the
1292 truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a
1293 whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by
1294 them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant
1295 voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,
1296 thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in
1297 any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly
1298 complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and
1299 completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it
1300 might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never
1301 heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.
1302 However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun
1303 there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while
1304 all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this
1305 harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty
1306 having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently
1307 pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair
1308 on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he
1309 then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed
1310 it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver
1311 hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no
1312 hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small
1313 scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now
1314 looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger
1315 stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker
1316 than ever I bolted a dinner.
1317 
1318 Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,
1319 but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make
1320 of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my
1321 comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely
1322 nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as
1323 much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken
1324 into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him
1325 that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a
1326 satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
1327 
1328 Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last
1329 showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him
1330 were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was
1331 all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty
1332 Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.
1333 Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green
1334 frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite
1335 plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard
1336 of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian
1337 country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps
1338 the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to
1339 mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!
1340 
1341 But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
1342 something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
1343 that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or
1344 wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he
1345 fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little
1346 deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a
1347 three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first
1348 I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved
1349 in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,
1350 and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded
1351 that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to
1352 be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing
1353 the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like
1354 a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks
1355 inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very
1356 appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
1357 
1358 I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
1359 ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes
1360 about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and
1361 places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship
1362 biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the
1363 shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty
1364 snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers
1365 (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded
1366 in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a
1367 little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the
1368 little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he
1369 never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by
1370 still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be
1371 praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,
1372 during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
1373 At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very
1374 unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
1375 carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
1376 
1377 All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and
1378 seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
1379 operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
1380 now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in
1381 which I had so long been bound.
1382 
1383 But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal
1384 one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of
1385 it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth
1386 at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next
1387 moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk
1388 between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not
1389 help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began
1390 feeling me.
1391 
1392 Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
1393 against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
1394 be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But
1395 his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill
1396 comprehended my meaning.
1397 
1398 "Who-e debel you?"--he at last said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I
1399 kill-e."  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about
1400 me in the dark.
1401 
1402 "Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted I.  "Landlord!
1403 Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!"
1404 
1405 "Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled
1406 the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered
1407 the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on
1408 fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the
1409 room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
1410 
1411 "Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here
1412 wouldn't harm a hair of your head."
1413 
1414 "Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that
1415 that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"
1416 
1417 "I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads
1418 around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look
1419 here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?"
1420 
1421 "Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
1422 sitting up in bed.
1423 
1424 "You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
1425 throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a
1426 civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a
1427 moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely
1428 looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,
1429 thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has
1430 just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.
1431 Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
1432 
1433 "Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,
1434 or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I
1435 will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed
1436 with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured."
1437 
1438 This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
1439 motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to
1440 say--I won't touch a leg of ye."
1441 
1442 "Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."
1443 
1444 I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
1445 
1446 
1447 
1448 CHAPTER 4
1449 
1450 The Counterpane.
1451 
1452 
1453 Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm
1454 thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had
1455 almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of
1456 patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;
1457 and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan
1458 labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise
1459 shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically
1460 in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various
1461 times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a
1462 strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as
1463 the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the
1464 quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
1465 sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was
1466 hugging me.
1467 
1468 My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was
1469 a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell
1470 me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely
1471 settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper
1472 or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had
1473 seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,
1474 somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed
1475 supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and
1476 packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon
1477 of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I
1478 felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went
1479 to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as
1480 possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the
1481 sheets.
1482 
1483 I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must
1484 elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!
1485 the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;
1486 the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in
1487 the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt
1488 worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in
1489 my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw
1490 myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a
1491 good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning
1492 me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the
1493 best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to
1494 my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great
1495 deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest
1496 subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled
1497 nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in
1498 dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped
1499 in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my
1500 frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a
1501 supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the
1502 counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,
1503 to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.
1504 For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most
1505 awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that
1506 if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be
1507 broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from
1508 me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and
1509 for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding
1510 attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often
1511 puzzle myself with it.
1512 
1513 Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
1514 supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,
1515 to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan
1516 arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events
1517 soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only
1518 alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his
1519 arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still
1520 hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.
1521 I now strove to rouse him--"Queequeg!"--but his only answer was a
1522 snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a
1523 horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the
1524 counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as
1525 if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;
1526 abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a
1527 tomahawk!  "Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!"  At
1528 length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant
1529 expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male
1530 in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;
1531 and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a
1532 Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a
1533 pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not
1534 altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
1535 consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning
1536 over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious
1537 misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a
1538 creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the
1539 character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to
1540 the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and
1541 sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress
1542 first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole
1543 apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,
1544 this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages
1545 have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous
1546 how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to
1547 Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and
1548 consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him
1549 from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my
1550 curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man
1551 like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well
1552 worth unusual regarding.
1553 
1554 He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall
1555 one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his
1556 boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
1557 next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under
1558 the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I
1559 inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of
1560 propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private
1561 when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature
1562 in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was
1563 just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest
1564 possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an
1565 undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very
1566 probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,
1567 if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of
1568 getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his
1569 hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began
1570 creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed
1571 to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made
1572 to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off
1573 of a bitter cold morning.
1574 
1575 Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
1576 street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
1577 into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
1578 Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots
1579 on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet
1580 somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as
1581 possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that
1582 time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but
1583 Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his
1584 ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his
1585 waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand
1586 centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.
1587 I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he
1588 takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden
1589 stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and
1590 striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous
1591 scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,
1592 this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I
1593 wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine
1594 steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the
1595 long straight edges are always kept.
1596 
1597 The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out
1598 of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and
1599 sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.
1600 
1601 
1602 
1603 CHAPTER 5
1604 
1605 Breakfast.
1606 
1607 
1608 I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted
1609 the grinning landlord very pleasantly.  I cherished no malice towards
1610 him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter
1611 of my bedfellow.
1612 
1613 However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
1614 good thing; the more's the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own
1615 proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not
1616 be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be
1617 spent in that way.  And the man that has anything bountifully
1618 laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you
1619 perhaps think for.
1620 
1621 The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in
1622 the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.
1623 They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and
1624 third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea
1625 blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny
1626 company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing
1627 monkey jackets for morning gowns.
1628 
1629 You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.
1630 This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue,
1631 and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three
1632 days landed from his Indian voyage.  That man next him looks a few
1633 shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.  In
1634 the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
1635 bleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.  But
1636 who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various
1637 tints, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one
1638 array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.
1639 
1640 "Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
1641 went to breakfast.
1642 
1643 They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at
1644 ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.  Not always, though:
1645 Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
1646 one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.
1647 But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as
1648 Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach,
1649 in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's
1650 performances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best
1651 mode of attaining a high social polish.  Still, for the most part,
1652 that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.
1653 
1654 These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
1655 after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear
1656 some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly
1657 every man maintained a profound silence.  And not only that, but they
1658 looked embarrassed.  Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom
1659 without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the
1660 high seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without
1661 winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of
1662 the same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly
1663 at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some
1664 sheepfold among the Green Mountains.  A curious sight; these bashful
1665 bears, these timid warrior whalemen!
1666 
1667 But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head
1668 of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.  To be sure I
1669 cannot say much for his breeding.  His greatest admirer could not
1670 have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with
1671 him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table
1672 with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the
1673 beefsteaks towards him.  But THAT was certainly very coolly done by
1674 him, and every one knows that in most people's estimation, to do
1675 anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
1676 
1677 We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he
1678 eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
1679 beefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when breakfast was over he
1680 withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his
1681 tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking
1682 with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.
1683 
1684 
1685 
1686 CHAPTER 6
1687 
1688 The Street.
1689 
1690 
1691 If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
1692 an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
1693 civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
1694 daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.
1695 
1696 In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
1697 frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from
1698 foreign parts.  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean
1699 mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.  Regent Street
1700 is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo
1701 Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives.  But New Bedford
1702 beats all Water Street and Wapping.  In these last-mentioned haunts
1703 you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand
1704 chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry
1705 on their bones unholy flesh.  It makes a stranger stare.
1706 
1707 But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,
1708 Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the
1709 whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see
1710 other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.  There
1711 weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New
1712 Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.  They
1713 are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled
1714 forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.
1715 Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.  In some
1716 things you would think them but a few hours old.  Look there! that
1717 chap strutting round the corner.  He wears a beaver hat and
1718 swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
1719 Here comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.
1720 
1721 No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a
1722 downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
1723 two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.  Now when
1724 a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a
1725 distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you
1726 should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.  In
1727 bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;
1728 straps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will
1729 burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven,
1730 straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.
1731 
1732 But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
1733 and bumpkins to show her visitors.  Not at all.  Still New Bedford is
1734 a queer place.  Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land
1735 would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast
1736 of Labrador.  As it is, parts of her back country are enough to
1737 frighten one, they look so bony.  The town itself is perhaps the
1738 dearest place to live in, in all New England.  It is a land of oil,
1739 true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.
1740 The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave
1741 them with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America
1742 will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more
1743 opulent, than in New Bedford.  Whence came they? how planted upon
1744 this once scraggy scoria of a country?
1745 
1746 Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
1747 mansion, and your question will be answered.  Yes; all these brave
1748 houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and
1749 Indian oceans.  One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up
1750 hither from the bottom of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat
1751 like that?
1752 
1753 In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
1754 daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
1755 You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they
1756 say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night
1757 recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.
1758 
1759 In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long
1760 avenues of green and gold.  And in August, high in air, the beautiful
1761 and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
1762 their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.  So omnipotent
1763 is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced
1764 bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside
1765 at creation's final day.
1766 
1767 And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.
1768 But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their
1769 cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.  Elsewhere
1770 match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell
1771 me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell
1772 them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous
1773 Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.
1774

1776 
1777 CHAPTER 7
1778 
1779 The Chapel.
1780 
1781 
1782 In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few
1783 are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or
1784 Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.  I am sure that
1785 I did not.
1786 
1787 Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
1788 special errand.  The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to
1789 driving sleet and mist.  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the
1790 cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.
1791 Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and
1792 sailors' wives and widows.  A muffled silence reigned, only broken at
1793 times by the shrieks of the storm.  Each silent worshipper seemed
1794 purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were
1795 insular and incommunicable.  The chaplain had not yet arrived; and
1796 there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing
1797 several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on
1798 either side the pulpit.  Three of them ran something like the
1799 following, but I do not pretend to quote:--

1840 THIS TABLET
1841 Is erected to his Memory
1842 BY
1843 HIS WIDOW.
1844 
1845 Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
1846 myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
1847 Queequeg near me.  Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was
1848 a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.  This
1849 savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;
1850 because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was
1851 not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.  Whether any of
1852 the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among
1853 the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded
1854 accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present
1855 wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief,
1856 that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose
1857 unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically
1858 caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.
1859 
1860 Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
1861 among flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the
1862 desolation that broods in bosoms like these.  What bitter blanks in
1863 those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!  What despair in
1864 those immovable inscriptions!  What deadly voids and unbidden
1865 infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and
1866 refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished
1867 without a grave.  As well might those tablets stand in the cave of
1868 Elephanta as here.
1869 
1870 In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
1871 why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
1872 tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it
1873 is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we
1874 prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle
1875 him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth;
1876 why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon
1877 immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,
1878 hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries
1879 ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we
1880 nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the
1881 living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a
1882 knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.  All these things are
1883 not without their meanings.
1884 
1885 But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
1886 dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
1887 
1888 It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
1889 Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
1890 light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
1891 had gone before me.  Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.  But
1892 somehow I grew merry again.  Delightful inducements to embark, fine
1893 chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an
1894 immortal by brevet.  Yes, there is death in this business of
1895 whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into
1896 Eternity.  But what then?  Methinks we have hugely mistaken this
1897 matter of Life and Death.  Methinks that what they call my shadow
1898 here on earth is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at
1899 things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun
1900 through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
1901 Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.  In fact take
1902 my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.  And therefore three
1903 cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they
1904 will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.
1905 
1906 
1907 
1908 CHAPTER 8
1909 
1910 The Pulpit.
1911 
1912 
1913 I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
1914 robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back
1915 upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the
1916 congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the
1917 chaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the
1918 whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a
1919 sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had
1920 dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,
1921 Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort
1922 of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for
1923 among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild
1924 gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth
1925 even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his
1926 history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the
1927 utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical
1928 peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life
1929 he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,
1930 and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran
1931 down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed
1932 almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had
1933 absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one
1934 removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,
1935 arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.
1936 
1937 Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
1938 regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
1939 floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
1940 architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
1941 finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular
1942 side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.
1943 The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome
1944 pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself
1945 nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole
1946 contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no
1947 means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the
1948 ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the
1949 man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
1950 sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted
1951 the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
1952 
1953 The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
1954 with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were
1955 of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first
1956 glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient
1957 for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.
1958 For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,
1959 slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up
1960 the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving
1961 him impregnable in his little Quebec.
1962 
1963 I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
1964 Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
1965 sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
1966 mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober
1967 reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something
1968 unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he
1969 signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward
1970 worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and
1971 wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is
1972 a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a
1973 perennial well of water within the walls.
1974 
1975 But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
1976 borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble
1977 cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its
1978 back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship
1979 beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and
1980 snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling
1981 clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed
1982 forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of
1983 radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver
1984 plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  "Ah,
1985 noble ship," the angel seemed to say, "beat on, beat on, thou noble
1986 ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the
1987 clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand."
1988 
1989 Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
1990 had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in
1991 the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
1992 projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's
1993 fiddle-headed beak.
1994 
1995 What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this
1996 earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit
1997 leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is
1998 first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From
1999 thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for
2000 favourable winds.  Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not
2001 a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.
2002 
2003 
2004 
2005 CHAPTER 9
2006 
2007 The Sermon.
2008 
2009 
2010 Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority
2011 ordered the scattered people to condense.  "Starboard gangway,
2012 there! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!
2013 Midships! midships!"
2014 
2015 There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
2016 still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again,
2017 and every eye on the preacher.
2018 
2019 He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his
2020 large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
2021 offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying
2022 at the bottom of the sea.
2023 
2024 This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of
2025 a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he
2026 commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
2027 the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and
2028 joy--
2029 
2030 "The ribs and terrors in the whale,
2031 Arched over me a dismal gloom,
2032 While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
2033 And lift me deepening down to doom.
2034 
2035 "I saw the opening maw of hell,
2036 With endless pains and sorrows there;
2037 Which none but they that feel can tell--
2038 Oh, I was plunging to despair.
2039 
2040 "In black distress, I called my God,
2041 When I could scarce believe him mine,
2042 He bowed his ear to my complaints--
2043 No more the whale did me confine.
2044 
2045 "With speed he flew to my relief,
2046 As on a radiant dolphin borne;
2047 Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
2048 The face of my Deliverer God.
2049 
2050 "My song for ever shall record
2051 That terrible, that joyful hour;
2052 I give the glory to my God,
2053 His all the mercy and the power.
2054 
2055 
2056 Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
2057 howling of the storm.  A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly
2058 turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand
2059 down upon the proper page, said: "Beloved shipmates, clinch the last
2060 verse of the first chapter of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great
2061 fish to swallow up Jonah.'"
2062 
2063 "Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is
2064 one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.
2065 Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a
2066 pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!  What a noble thing is that
2067 canticle in the fish's belly!  How billow-like and boisterously
2068 grand!  We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the
2069 kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is
2070 about us!  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?
2071 Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful
2072 men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,
2073 it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,
2074 hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,
2075 repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.
2076 As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in
2077 his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what
2078 that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.
2079 But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to
2080 do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors
2081 to persuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it
2082 is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God
2083 consists.
2084 
2085 "With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at
2086 God, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men
2087 will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the
2088 Captains of this earth.  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and
2089 seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a
2090 hitherto unheeded meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have
2091 been no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of
2092 learned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as
2093 far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in
2094 those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
2095 Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly
2096 coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more
2097 than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the
2098 Straits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought
2099 to flee world-wide from God?  Miserable man!  Oh! most contemptible
2100 and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking
2101 from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar
2102 hastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his
2103 look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere
2104 suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a
2105 deck.  How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,
2106 valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with
2107 their adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the
2108 Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps
2109 on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the
2110 moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil
2111 eye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
2112 confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of
2113 the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome
2114 but still serious way, one whispers to the other--"Jack, he's robbed
2115 a widow;" or, "Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry
2116 lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or
2117 belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom."  Another runs to
2118 read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which
2119 the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the
2120 apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his
2121 person.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his
2122 sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their
2123 hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his
2124 boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will
2125 not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.
2126 So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be
2127 the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into
2128 the cabin.
2129 
2130 "'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
2131 out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?'  Oh! how that harmless
2132 question mangles Jonah!  For the instant he almost turns to flee
2133 again.  But he rallies.  'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;
2134 how soon sail ye, sir?'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up
2135 to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he
2136 hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.  'We
2137 sail with the next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still
2138 intently eyeing him.  'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest
2139 man that goes a passenger.'  Ha!  Jonah, that's another stab.  But he
2140 swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.  'I'll sail with
2141 ye,'--he says,--'the passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.'
2142 For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not
2143 to be overlooked in this history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere
2144 the craft did sail.  And taken with the context, this is full of
2145 meaning.
2146 
2147 "Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects
2148 crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.
2149 In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,
2150 and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at
2151 all frontiers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of
2152 Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the
2153 usual sum; and it's assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah
2154 is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that
2155 paves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,
2156 prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to
2157 find a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is
2158 put down for his passage.  'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah
2159 now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'  'Thou lookest like it,' says
2160 the Captain, 'there's thy room.'  Jonah enters, and would lock the
2161 door, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling
2162 there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something
2163 about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked
2164 within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into
2165 his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on
2166 his forehead.  The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that
2167 contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah
2168 feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the
2169 whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.
2170 
2171 "Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
2172 oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the
2173 wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
2174 all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
2175 with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
2176 itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
2177 hung.  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his
2178 tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
2179 fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.  But that
2180 contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.  The floor, the
2181 ceiling, and the side, are all awry.  'Oh! so my conscience hangs in
2182 me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of
2183 my soul are all in crookedness!'
2184 
2185 "Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
2186 reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of
2187 the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into
2188 him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in
2189 giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;
2190 and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over
2191 him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the
2192 wound, and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in
2193 his berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning
2194 down to sleep.
2195 
2196 "And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;
2197 and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all
2198 careening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends, was the first of
2199 recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he
2200 will not bear the wicked burden.  A dreadful storm comes on, the
2201 ship is like to break.  But now when the boatswain calls all hands to
2202 lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;
2203 when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank
2204 thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this
2205 raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.  He sees no black sky
2206 and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or
2207 heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open
2208 mouth is cleaving the seas after him.  Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
2209 down into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken
2210 it, and was fast asleep.  But the frightened master comes to him, and
2211 shrieks in his dead ear, 'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!'
2212 Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his
2213 feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon
2214 the sea.  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow
2215 leaping over the bulwarks.  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,
2216 and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the
2217 mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.  And ever, as the
2218 white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the
2219 blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing
2220 high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.
2221 
2222 "Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.  In all his
2223 cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.  The
2224 sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,
2225 and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter
2226 to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose
2227 cause this great tempest was upon them.  The lot is Jonah's; that
2228 discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.
2229 'What is thine occupation?  Whence comest thou?  Thy country?  What
2230 people?  But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.  The
2231 eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they
2232 not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another
2233 answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is
2234 forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.
2235 
2236 "'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of
2237 Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!'  Fear him, O Jonah?
2238 Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN!  Straightway, he now
2239 goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more
2240 and more appalled, but still are pitiful.  For when Jonah, not yet
2241 supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness
2242 of his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him
2243 and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this
2244 great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek
2245 by other means to save the ship.  But all in vain; the indignant gale
2246 howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the
2247 other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.
2248 
2249 "And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
2250 when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
2251 is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth
2252 water behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a
2253 masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops
2254 seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to
2255 all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.  Then
2256 Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.  But observe his
2257 prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.  For sinful as he is, Jonah does
2258 not weep and wail for direct deliverance.  He feels that his dreadful
2259 punishment is just.  He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting
2260 himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will
2261 still look towards His holy temple.  And here, shipmates, is true and
2262 faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for
2263 punishment.  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is
2264 shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.
2265 Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin
2266 but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.  Sin not;
2267 but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah."
2268 
2269 While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
2270 slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
2271 when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
2272 His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed
2273 the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from
2274 off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all
2275 his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to
2276 them.
2277 
2278 There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
2279 leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
2280 closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
2281 
2282 But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head
2283 lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake
2284 these words:
2285 
2286 "Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
2287 upon me.  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson
2288 that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still
2289 more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.  And now how gladly
2290 would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there
2291 where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads
2292 ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a
2293 pilot of the living God.  How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or
2294 speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those
2295 unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at
2296 the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to
2297 escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But God is
2298 everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.  As we have seen, God came
2299 upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of
2300 doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the
2301 seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down,
2302 and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the watery world
2303 of woe bowled over him.  Yet even then beyond the reach of any
2304 plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon the
2305 ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting
2306 prophet when he cried.  Then God spake unto the fish; and from the
2307 shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up
2308 towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and
2309 earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of
2310 the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears,
2311 like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the
2312 ocean--Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.  And what was that,
2313 shipmates?  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!  That was
2314 it!
2315 
2316 "This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
2317 the living God who slights it.  Woe to him whom this world charms
2318 from Gospel duty!  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters
2319 when God has brewed them into a gale!  Woe to him who seeks to please
2320 rather than to appal!  Woe to him whose good name is more to him than
2321 goodness!  Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!  Woe
2322 to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!
2323 Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching
2324 to others is himself a castaway!"
2325 
2326 He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
2327 face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out
2328 with a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard
2329 hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of
2330 that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.  Is not the
2331 main-truck higher than the kelson is low?  Delight is to him--a far,
2332 far upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and
2333 commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.
2334 Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of
2335 this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.  Delight is to
2336 him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and
2337 destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of
2338 Senators and Judges.  Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who
2339 acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a
2340 patriot to heaven.  Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the
2341 billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this
2342 sure Keel of the Ages.  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be
2343 his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O
2344 Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I
2345 die.  I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or
2346 mine own.  Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what
2347 is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"
2348 
2349 He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face
2350 with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had
2351 departed, and he was left alone in the place.
2352 
2353 
2354 
2355 CHAPTER 10
2356 
2357 A Bosom Friend.
2358 
2359 
2360 Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
2361 quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some
2362 time.  He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on
2363 the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face
2364 that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
2365 jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
2366 himself in his heathenish way.
2367 
2368 But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,
2369 going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his
2370 lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every
2371 fiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly
2372 around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of
2373 astonishment.  He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming
2374 to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count
2375 more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties
2376 being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages
2377 was excited.
2378 
2379 With much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and
2380 hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his
2381 countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means
2382 disagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his unearthly
2383 tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and
2384 in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of
2385 a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.  And besides all this,
2386 there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his
2387 uncouthness could not altogether maim.  He looked like a man who had
2388 never cringed and never had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,
2389 that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
2390 brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,
2391 this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
2392 phrenologically an excellent one.  It may seem ridiculous, but it
2393 reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular
2394 busts of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
2395 from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two
2396 long promontories thickly wooded on top.  Queequeg was George
2397 Washington cannibalistically developed.
2398 
2399 Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to
2400 be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
2401 presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
2402 appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
2403 book.  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the
2404 night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had
2405 found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this
2406 indifference of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at
2407 times you do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are
2408 overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a
2409 Socratic wisdom.  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at
2410 all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made
2411 no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the
2412 circle of his acquaintances.  All this struck me as mighty singular;
2413 yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.
2414 Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of
2415 Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown
2416 among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet
2417 Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the
2418 utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to
2419 himself.  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt
2420 he had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to
2421 be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living
2422 or so striving.  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives
2423 himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic
2424 old woman, he must have "broken his digester."
2425 
2426 As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
2427 mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it
2428 then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms
2429 gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,
2430 solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began
2431 to be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more
2432 my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish
2433 world.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.  There he sat, his very
2434 indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized
2435 hypocrisies and bland deceits.  Wild he was; a very sight of sights
2436 to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.
2437 And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were
2438 the very magnets that thus drew me.  I'll try a pagan friend, thought
2439 I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.  I drew
2440 my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my
2441 best to talk with him meanwhile.  At first he little noticed these
2442 advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night's
2443 hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
2444 bedfellows.  I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,
2445 perhaps a little complimented.
2446 
2447 We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
2448 him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
2449 that were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
2450 went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
2451 be seen in this famous town.  Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
2452 producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And
2453 then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping
2454 it regularly passing between us.
2455 
2456 If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's
2457 breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
2458 left us cronies.  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
2459 unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
2460 forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
2461 henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we
2462 were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.
2463 In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed
2464 far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple
2465 savage those old rules would not apply.
2466 
2467 After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
2468 together.  He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
2469 enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
2470 thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
2471 mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of
2472 them towards me, and said it was mine.  I was going to remonstrate;
2473 but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets.  I let
2474 them stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his
2475 idol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and
2476 symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well
2477 knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case
2478 he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
2479 
2480 I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
2481 Presbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator
2482 in worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.
2483 Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
2484 earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an
2485 insignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is
2486 worship?--to do the will of God--THAT is worship.  And what is the
2487 will of God?--to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man
2488 to do to me--THAT is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow
2489 man.  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why,
2490 unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.
2491 Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn
2492 idolator.  So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent
2493 little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before
2494 him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and
2495 went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.
2496 But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.
2497 
2498 How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for
2499 confidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,
2500 there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old
2501 couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.  Thus,
2502 then, in our hearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving
2503 pair.
2504 
2505 
2506 
2507 CHAPTER 11
2508 
2509 Nightgown.
2510 
2511 
2512 We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
2513 Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
2514 over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
2515 and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations,
2516 what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we
2517 felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down
2518 the future.
2519 
2520 Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
2521 began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
2522 sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
2523 head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
2524 noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans.  We
2525 felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of
2526 doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire
2527 in the room.  The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily
2528 warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality
2529 in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Nothing
2530 exists in itself.  If you flatter yourself that you are all over
2531 comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to
2532 be comfortable any more.  But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,
2533 the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled,
2534 why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most
2535 delightfully and unmistakably warm.  For this reason a sleeping
2536 apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the
2537 luxurious discomforts of the rich.  For the height of this sort of
2538 deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
2539 your snugness and the cold of the outer air.  Then there you lie like
2540 the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.
2541 
2542 We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all
2543 at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets,
2544 whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way
2545 of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the
2546 snugness of being in bed.  Because no man can ever feel his own
2547 identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were
2548 indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more
2549 congenial to our clayey part.  Upon opening my eyes then, and coming
2550 out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and
2551 coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I
2552 experienced a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the
2553 hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,
2554 seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong
2555 desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.  Be it said, that
2556 though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed
2557 the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when
2558 love once comes to bend them.  For now I liked nothing better than
2559 to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be
2560 full of such serene household joy then.  I no more felt unduly
2561 concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance.  I was only alive
2562 to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a
2563 blanket with a real friend.  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our
2564 shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till
2565 slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated
2566 by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
2567 
2568 Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to
2569 far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native
2570 island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and
2571 tell it.  He gladly complied.  Though at the time I but ill
2572 comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when
2573 I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me
2574 to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton
2575 I give.
2576 
2577 
2578 
2579 CHAPTER 12
2580 
2581 Biographical.
2582 
2583 
2584 Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West
2585 and South.  It is not down in any map; true places never are.
2586 
2587 When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
2588 a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
2589 sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong
2590 desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
2591 two.  His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;
2592 and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
2593 unconquerable warriors.  There was excellent blood in his
2594 veins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal
2595 propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.
2596 
2597 A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a
2598 passage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full complement
2599 of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's
2600 influence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his
2601 canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship
2602 must pass through when she quitted the island.  On one side was a
2603 coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove
2604 thickets that grew out into the water.  Hiding his canoe, still
2605 afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in
2606 the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like
2607 a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his
2608 foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing
2609 himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and
2610 swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.
2611 
2612 In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
2613 cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
2614 Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
2615 wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and
2616 told him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young
2617 savage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin.
2618 They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.  But
2619 like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,
2620 Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily
2621 gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.  For at
2622 bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn
2623 among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still
2624 happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they
2625 were.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that
2626 even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more
2627 so, than all his father's heathens.  Arrived at last in old Sag
2628 Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to
2629 Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,
2630 poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.  Thought he, it's a wicked world
2631 in all meridians; I'll die a pagan.
2632 
2633 And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these
2634 Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.
2635 Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.
2636 
2637 By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and
2638 having a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and
2639 gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.  He answered
2640 no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather
2641 Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled
2642 throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he
2643 would return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.  For the
2644 nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in
2645 all four oceans.  They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed
2646 iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.
2647 
2648 I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
2649 movements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.
2650 Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed
2651 him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most
2652 promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.  He at
2653 once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same
2654 vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with
2655 me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly
2656 dip into the Potluck of both worlds.  To all this I joyously
2657 assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was
2658 an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great
2659 usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries
2660 of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant
2661 seamen.
2662 
2663 His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg
2664 embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
2665 light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very
2666 soon were sleeping.
2667 
2668 
2669 CHAPTER 13
2670 
2671 Wheelbarrow.
2672 
2673 
2674 Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a
2675 barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using,
2676 however, my comrade's money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the
2677 boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had
2678 sprung up between me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin's cock
2679 and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me
2680 concerning the very person whom I now companied with.
2681 
2682 We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
2683 poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went
2684 down to "the Moss," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at
2685 the wharf.  As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg
2686 so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
2687 streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.  But
2688 we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and
2689 Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon
2690 barbs.  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him
2691 ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own
2692 harpoons.  To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I
2693 hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own
2694 harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal
2695 combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.  In short,
2696 like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows
2697 armed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish
2698 them--even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his
2699 own harpoon.
2700 
2701 Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story
2702 about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.  It was in Sag Harbor.
2703 The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry
2704 his heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant about
2705 the thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise
2706 way in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it;
2707 lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the
2708 wharf.  "Why," said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than
2709 that, one would think.  Didn't the people laugh?"
2710 
2711 Upon this, he told me another story.  The people of his island of
2712 Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant
2713 water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a
2714 punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament
2715 on the braided mat where the feast is held.  Now a certain grand
2716 merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all
2717 accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea
2718 captain--this commander was invited to the wedding feast of
2719 Queequeg's sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.  Well;
2720 when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo
2721 cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of
2722 honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the
2723 High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father.  Grace being
2724 said,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though
2725 Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to
2726 our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance
2727 upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said,
2728 the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the
2729 island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
2730 into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.  Seeing himself
2731 placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking
2732 himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a
2733 mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain
2734 coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I
2735 suppose for a huge finger-glass.  "Now," said Queequeg, "what you
2736 tink now?--Didn't our people laugh?"
2737 
2738 At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
2739 schooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one
2740 side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered
2741 trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and
2742 mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by
2743 side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at
2744 last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with
2745 blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening
2746 that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long
2747 voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a
2748 third, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness,
2749 yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.
2750 
2751 Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the
2752 little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
2753 snortings.  How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that
2754 turnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks
2755 of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity
2756 of the sea which will permit no records.
2757 
2758 At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
2759 His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
2760 teeth.  On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
2761 the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.
2762 Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
2763 wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land
2764 tornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the
2765 plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering
2766 glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that
2767 two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man
2768 were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there
2769 were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense
2770 greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.
2771 Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his
2772 back.  I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.  Dropping his
2773 harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
2774 miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the
2775 air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow
2776 landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his
2777 back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a
2778 puff.
2779 
2780 "Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
2781 "Capting, Capting, here's the devil."
2782 
2783 "Hallo, YOU sir," cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
2784 up to Queequeg, "what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don't you know
2785 you might have killed that chap?"
2786 
2787 "What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
2788 
2789 "He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there,"
2790 pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.
2791 
2792 "Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an
2793 unearthly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;
2794 Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"
2795 
2796 "Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if
2797 you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye."
2798 
2799 But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain
2800 to mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had
2801 parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from
2802 side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.
2803 The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept
2804 overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the
2805 boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and
2806 back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant
2807 seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,
2808 and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed
2809 towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower
2810 jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,
2811 Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of
2812 the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,
2813 and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as
2814 it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way
2815 trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and
2816 while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped
2817 to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.
2818 For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing
2819 his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his
2820 brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand
2821 and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had
2822 gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,
2823 Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see
2824 just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes
2825 more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the
2826 other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The
2827 poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;
2828 the captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg
2829 like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.
2830 
2831 Was there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that
2832 he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.
2833 He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine
2834 off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning
2835 against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to
2836 be saying to himself--"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all
2837 meridians.  We cannibals must help these Christians."
2838 
2839 
2840 
2841 CHAPTER 14
2842 
2843 Nantucket.
2844 
2845 
2846 Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after
2847 a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
2848 
2849 Nantucket!  Take out your map and look at it.  See what a real corner
2850 of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more
2851 lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.  Look at it--a mere hillock,
2852 and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.  There is more
2853 sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for
2854 blotting paper.  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to
2855 plant weeds there, they don't grow naturally; that they import Canada
2856 thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a
2857 leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried
2858 about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant
2859 toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer
2860 time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's
2861 walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like
2862 Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every
2863 way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean,
2864 that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be
2865 found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.  But these
2866 extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.
2867 
2868 Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
2869 settled by the red-men.  Thus goes the legend.  In olden times an
2870 eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an
2871 infant Indian in his talons.  With loud lament the parents saw their
2872 child borne out of sight over the wide waters.  They resolved to
2873 follow in the same direction.  Setting out in their canoes, after a
2874 perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an
2875 empty ivory casket,--the poor little Indian's skeleton.
2876 
2877 What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should
2878 take to the sea for a livelihood!  They first caught crabs and
2879 quohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for
2880 mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured
2881 cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea,
2882 explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of
2883 circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring's Straits; and in
2884 all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the
2885 mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous
2886 and most mountainous!  That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed
2887 with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics
2888 are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!
2889 
2890 And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing
2891 from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery
2892 world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the
2893 Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did
2894 Poland.  Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;
2895 let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing
2896 banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the
2897 Nantucketer's.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own
2898 empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.  Merchant
2899 ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even
2900 pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the
2901 road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like
2902 themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless
2903 deep itself.  The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea;
2904 he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro
2905 ploughing it as his own special plantation.  THERE is his home; THERE
2906 lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though
2907 it overwhelmed all the millions in China.  He lives on the sea, as
2908 prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs
2909 them as chamois hunters climb the Alps.  For years he knows not the
2910 land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another
2911 world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.  With the
2912 landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep
2913 between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of
2914 land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very
2915 pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.

2919 CHAPTER 15
2920 
2921 Chowder.
2922 
2923 
2924 It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
2925 anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
2926 business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.  The
2927 landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea
2928 Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one
2929 of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured
2930 us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.
2931 In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than
2932 try pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had given us
2933 about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened
2934 a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard
2935 hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that
2936 done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these
2937 crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially
2938 as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our
2939 first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas
2940 I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.
2941 However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and
2942 then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at
2943 last came to something which there was no mistaking.
2944 
2945 Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,
2946 swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
2947 old doorway.  The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the
2948 other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a
2949 gallows.  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the
2950 time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague
2951 misgiving.  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two
2952 remaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.
2953 It's ominous, thinks I.  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my
2954 first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's
2955 chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!
2956 Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
2957 
2958 I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
2959 with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
2960 under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an
2961 injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple
2962 woollen shirt.
2963 
2964 "Get along with ye," said she to the man, "or I'll be combing ye!"
2965 
2966 "Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all right.  There's Mrs. Hussey."
2967 
2968 And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
2969 Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.  Upon
2970 making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
2971 postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little
2972 room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
2973 concluded repast, turned round to us and said--"Clam or Cod?"
2974 
2975 "What's that about Cods, ma'am?" said I, with much politeness.
2976 
2977 "Clam or Cod?" she repeated.
2978 
2979 "A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?"
2980 says I, "but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
2981 time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"
2982 
2983 But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
2984 Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear
2985 nothing but the word "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door
2986 leading to the kitchen, and bawling out "clam for two," disappeared.
2987 
2988 "Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper for
2989 us both on one clam?"
2990 
2991 However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
2992 apparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking
2993 chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh, sweet
2994 friends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely
2995 bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted
2996 pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and
2997 plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.  Our appetites being
2998 sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing
2999 his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being
3000 surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when
3001 leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod
3002 announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.  Stepping to
3003 the kitchen door, I uttered the word "cod" with great emphasis, and
3004 resumed my seat.  In a few moments the savoury steam came forth
3005 again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine
3006 cod-chowder was placed before us.
3007 
3008 We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks
3009 I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?
3010 What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?  "But
3011 look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl?  Where's your
3012 harpoon?"
3013 
3014 Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved
3015 its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.  Chowder
3016 for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till
3017 you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.  The
3018 area before the house was paved with clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a
3019 polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his
3020 account books bound in superior old shark-skin.  There was a fishy
3021 flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till
3022 one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some
3023 fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish
3024 remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's
3025 decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
3026 
3027 Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
3028 concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to
3029 precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and
3030 demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.  "Why
3031 not? said I; "every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why
3032 not?"  "Because it's dangerous," says she.  "Ever since young Stiggs
3033 coming from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years
3034 and a half, with only three barrels of ILE, was found dead in my
3035 first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I
3036 allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at
3037 night.  So, Mr. Queequeg" (for she had learned his name), "I will
3038 just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning.  But the
3039 chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?"
3040 
3041 "Both," says I; "and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of
3042 variety."
3043 
3044 
3045 
3046 CHAPTER 16
3047 
3048 The Ship.
3049 
3050 
3051 In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surprise and
3052 no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had
3053 been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little
3054 god--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly
3055 insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among
3056 the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;
3057 instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of
3058 the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed
3059 befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a
3060 vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light
3061 upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in
3062 that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present
3063 irrespective of Queequeg.
3064 
3065 I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed
3066 great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising
3067 forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a
3068 rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the
3069 whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
3070 
3071 Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the
3072 selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.  I had not a
3073 little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best
3074 fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my
3075 remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to
3076 acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a
3077 determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly
3078 settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving
3079 Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that
3080 it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,
3081 and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could
3082 find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never
3083 could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,
3084 then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his
3085 sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.
3086 After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt
3087 that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The
3088 Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know
3089 the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt
3090 remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts
3091 Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about
3092 the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,
3093 going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then
3094 decided that this was the very ship for us.
3095 
3096 You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
3097 know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
3098 galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
3099 rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the
3100 old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned
3101 claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the
3102 typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was
3103 darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and
3104 Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut
3105 somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
3106 overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of
3107 the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and
3108 wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury
3109 Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,
3110 were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild
3111 business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old
3112 Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another
3113 vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal
3114 owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his
3115 chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid
3116 it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
3117 unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or
3118 bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,
3119 his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of
3120 trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the
3121 chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open
3122 bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp
3123 teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old
3124 hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks
3125 of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.
3126 Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a
3127 tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the
3128 long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who
3129 steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he
3130 holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but
3131 somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.
3132 
3133 Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having
3134 authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,
3135 at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort
3136 of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It
3137 seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical
3138 shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of
3139 limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws
3140 of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a
3141 circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each
3142 other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose
3143 hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old
3144 Pottowottamie Sachem's head.  A triangular opening faced towards the
3145 bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view
3146 forward.
3147 
3148 And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who
3149 by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and
3150 the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden
3151 of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling
3152 all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of
3153 a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
3154 constructed.
3155 
3156 There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance
3157 of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old
3158 seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker
3159 style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the
3160 minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen
3161 from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
3162 windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become
3163 pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
3164 
3165 "Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, advancing to the door of
3166 the tent.
3167 
3168 "Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of
3169 him?" he demanded.
3170 
3171 "I was thinking of shipping."
3172 
3173 "Thou wast, wast thou?  I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in
3174 a stove boat?"
3175 
3176 "No, Sir, I never have."
3177 
3178 "Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?
3179 
3180 "Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.  I've been
3181 several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--"
3182 
3183 "Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.  Dost see
3184 that leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou
3185 talkest of the marchant service to me again.  Marchant service
3186 indeed!  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in
3187 those marchant ships.  But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a
3188 whaling, eh?--it looks a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not
3189 been a pirate, hast thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst
3190 thou?--Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to
3191 sea?"
3192 
3193 I protested my innocence of these things.  I saw that under the mask
3194 of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
3195 Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
3196 distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
3197 Vineyard.
3198 
3199 "But what takes thee a-whaling?  I want to know that before I think
3200 of shipping ye."
3201 
3202 "Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see the world."
3203 
3204 "Want to see what whaling is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain
3205 Ahab?"
3206 
3207 "Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"
3208 
3209 "Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship."
3210 
3211 "I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain
3212 himself."
3213 
3214 "Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,
3215 young man.  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod
3216 fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including
3217 crew.  We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if
3218 thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can
3219 put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past
3220 backing out.  Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find
3221 that he has only one leg."
3222 
3223 "What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?"
3224 
3225 "Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,
3226 chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped
3227 a boat!--ah, ah!"
3228 
3229 I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched
3230 at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly
3231 as I could, "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could
3232 I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,
3233 though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of
3234 the accident."
3235 
3236 "Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou
3237 dost not talk shark a bit.  SURE, ye've been to sea before now; sure
3238 of that?"
3239 
3240 "Sir," said I, "I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in
3241 the merchant--"
3242 
3243 "Hard down out of that!  Mind what I said about the marchant
3244 service--don't aggravate me--I won't have it.  But let us understand
3245 each other.  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye
3246 yet feel inclined for it?"
3247 
3248 "I do, sir."
3249 
3250 "Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
3251 whale's throat, and then jump after it?  Answer, quick!"
3252 
3253 "I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to
3254 be got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact."
3255 
3256 "Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to
3257 find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in
3258 order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.
3259 Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the
3260 weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there."
3261 
3262 For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
3263 knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.
3264 But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg
3265 started me on the errand.
3266 
3267 Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the
3268 ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
3269 pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but
3270 exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that
3271 I could see.
3272 
3273 "Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back; "what did ye
3274 see?"
3275 
3276 "Not much," I replied--"nothing but water; considerable horizon
3277 though, and there's a squall coming up, I think."
3278 
3279 "Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to
3280 go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can't ye see the world
3281 where you stand?"
3282 
3283 I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and
3284 the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all
3285 this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed
3286 his willingness to ship me.
3287 
3288 "And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off," he added--"come
3289 along with ye."  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
3290 cabin.
3291 
3292 Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
3293 surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along
3294 with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the
3295 other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by
3296 a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery
3297 wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of
3298 plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest
3299 their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in
3300 approved state stocks bringing in good interest.
3301 
3302 Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
3303 Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and
3304 to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure
3305 the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously
3306 modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of
3307 these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and
3308 whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a
3309 vengeance.
3310 
3311 So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
3312 Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in
3313 childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of
3314 the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
3315 adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
3316 unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
3317 unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And
3318 when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,
3319 with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the
3320 stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest
3321 waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been
3322 led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all
3323 nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin
3324 voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some
3325 help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty
3326 language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty
3327 pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all
3328 detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other
3329 circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness
3330 at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made
3331 so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,
3332 all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do
3333 with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if
3334 indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the
3335 Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
3336 
3337 Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired
3338 whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what
3339 are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious
3340 things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been
3341 originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket
3342 Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many
3343 unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not
3344 moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as
3345 altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,
3346 was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain
3347 Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms
3348 against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the
3349 Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet
3350 had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of
3351 leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,
3352 the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do
3353 not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably
3354 he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a
3355 man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.
3356 This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short
3357 clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied
3358 waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,
3359 and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded
3360 his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the
3361 goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet
3362 receiving of his well-earned income.
3363 
3364 Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
3365 incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
3366 task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
3367 curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his
3368 crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the
3369 hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially
3370 for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the
3371 least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but
3372 somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work
3373 out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured
3374 eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till
3375 you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to
3376 work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and
3377 idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact
3378 embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he
3379 carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,
3380 economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
3381 
3382 Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
3383 followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the
3384 decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always
3385 sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His
3386 broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his
3387 drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he
3388 seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.
3389 
3390 "Bildad," cried Captain Peleg, "at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have
3391 been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
3392 certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?"
3393 
3394 As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
3395 Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
3396 and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
3397 
3398 "He says he's our man, Bildad," said Peleg, "he wants to ship."
3399 
3400 "Dost thee?" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
3401 
3402 "I dost," said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
3403 
3404 "What do ye think of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.
3405 
3406 "He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
3407 his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
3408 
3409 I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as
3410 Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I
3411 said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a
3412 chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink
3413 before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think
3414 it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be
3415 willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the
3416 whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the
3417 captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that
3418 these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining
3419 to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware
3420 that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very
3421 large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a
3422 ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I
3423 had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the
3424 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that
3425 might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they
3426 call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had
3427 a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear
3428 out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which
3429 I would not have to pay one stiver.
3430 
3431 It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
3432 fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of
3433 those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite
3434 content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am
3435 putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I
3436 thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not
3437 have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was
3438 of a broad-shouldered make.
3439 
3440 But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
3441 receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had
3442 heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony
3443 Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,
3444 therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,
3445 left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.
3446 And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty
3447 deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on
3448 board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his
3449 Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying
3450 to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small
3451 surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these
3452 proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself
3453 out of his book, "LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
3454 where moth--"
3455 
3456 "Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say, what lay
3457 shall we give this young man?"
3458 
3459 "Thou knowest best," was the sepulchral reply, "the seven hundred and
3460 seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust
3461 do corrupt, but LAY--'"
3462 
3463 LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
3464 seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for
3465 one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do
3466 corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though
3467 from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a
3468 landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven
3469 hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you
3470 come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven
3471 hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less
3472 than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought
3473 at the time.
3474 
3475 "Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, "thou dost not want to
3476 swindle this young man! he must have more than that."
3477 
3478 "Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said Bildad, without
3479 lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--"for where your treasure
3480 is, there will your heart be also."
3481 
3482 "I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg, "do
3483 ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say."
3484 
3485 Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
3486 "Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider
3487 the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and
3488 orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the
3489 labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those
3490 widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,
3491 Captain Peleg."
3492 
3493 "Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
3494 cabin.  "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in
3495 these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that
3496 would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed
3497 round Cape Horn."
3498 
3499 "Captain Peleg," said Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be drawing
3500 ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art
3501 still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy
3502 conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee
3503 foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg."
3504 
3505 "Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,
3506 ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature
3507 that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again
3508 to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a
3509 live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye
3510 canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!"
3511 
3512 As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
3513 marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded
3514 him.
3515 
3516 Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
3517 responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up
3518 all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
3519 commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,
3520 who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the
3521 awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again
3522 on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest
3523 intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg
3524 and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,
3525 there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,
3526 though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  "Whew!"
3527 he whistled at last--"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.
3528 Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,
3529 will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank
3530 ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye
3531 say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth
3532 lay."
3533 
3534 "Captain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend with me who wants to ship
3535 too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?"
3536 
3537 "To be sure," said Peleg.  "Fetch him along, and we'll look at him."
3538 
3539 "What lay does he want?" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book
3540 in which he had again been burying himself.
3541 
3542 "Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg.  "Has he ever
3543 whaled it any?" turning to me.
3544 
3545 "Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg."
3546 
3547 "Well, bring him along then."
3548 
3549 And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that
3550 I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the
3551 identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round
3552 the Cape.
3553 
3554 But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the
3555 Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
3556 indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,
3557 and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself
3558 visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are
3559 so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,
3560 that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of
3561 that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,
3562 but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it
3563 is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing
3564 yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,
3565 inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
3566 
3567 "And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;
3568 thou art shipped."
3569 
3570 "Yes, but I should like to see him."
3571 
3572 "But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know
3573 exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
3574 house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't
3575 sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't
3576 always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,
3577 Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him
3578 well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,
3579 Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you
3580 may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;
3581 Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to
3582 deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,
3583 stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest
3584 that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he
3585 ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,
3586 was a crowned king!"
3587 
3588 "And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
3589 they not lick his blood?"
3590 
3591 "Come hither to me--hither, hither," said Peleg, with a significance
3592 in his eye that almost startled me.  "Look ye, lad; never say that on
3593 board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name
3594 himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed
3595 mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old
3596 squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove
3597 prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the
3598 same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;
3599 I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good
3600 man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good
3601 man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,
3602 aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the
3603 passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was
3604 the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
3605 about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost
3606 his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of
3607 moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass
3608 off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,
3609 it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad
3610 one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he
3611 happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not
3612 three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that
3613 sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any
3614 utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if
3615 he be, Ahab has his humanities!"
3616 
3617 As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
3618 incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
3619 wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the
3620 time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know
3621 what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a
3622 strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all
3623 describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.  But I felt
3624 it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt
3625 impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he
3626 was known to me then.  However, my thoughts were at length carried in
3627 other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.
3628 
3629 
3630 
3631 CHAPTER 17
3632 
3633 The Ramadan.
3634 
3635 
3636 As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue
3637 all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for
3638 I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious
3639 obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my
3640 heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a
3641 toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,
3642 who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,
3643 bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on
3644 account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his
3645 name.
3646 
3647 I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
3648 things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
3649 pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
3650 subjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
3651 absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?
3652 Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to
3653 be content; and there let him rest.  All our arguing with him would
3654 not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us
3655 all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow
3656 dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.
3657 
3658 Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
3659 rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;
3660 but no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
3661 "Queequeg," said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.  "I say,
3662 Queequeg! why don't you speak?  It's I--Ishmael."  But all remained
3663 still as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such
3664 abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I
3665 looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner
3666 of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister
3667 one.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line
3668 of the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting
3669 against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the
3670 landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting
3671 to the chamber.  That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since
3672 the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without
3673 it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.
3674 
3675 "Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all still.  Something must have happened.
3676 Apoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly
3677 resisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the
3678 first person I met--the chamber-maid.  "La! la!" she cried, "I
3679 thought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after
3680 breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and
3681 it's been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had
3682 both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,
3683 ma'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!"--and with these
3684 cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.
3685 
3686 Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
3687 vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the
3688 occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black
3689 boy meantime.
3690 
3691 "Wood-house!" cried I, "which way to it?  Run for God's sake, and
3692 fetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a
3693 stroke; depend upon it!"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing
3694 up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the
3695 mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her
3696 countenance.
3697 
3698 "What's the matter with you, young man?"
3699 
3700 "Get the axe!  For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I
3701 pry it open!"
3702 
3703 "Look here," said the landlady, quickly putting down the
3704 vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; "look here; are you
3705 talking about prying open any of my doors?"--and with that she seized
3706 my arm.  "What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you,
3707 shipmate?"
3708 
3709 In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
3710 the whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side
3711 of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--"No!  I
3712 haven't seen it since I put it there."  Running to a little closet
3713 under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told
3714 me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.  "He's killed himself," she
3715 cried.  "It's unfort'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another
3716 counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my
3717 house.  Has the poor lad a sister?  Where's that girl?--there, Betty,
3718 go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with--"no
3719 suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;"--might as
3720 well kill both birds at once.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his
3721 ghost!  What's that noise there?  You, young man, avast there!"
3722 
3723 And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
3724 open the door.
3725 
3726 "I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled.  Go for the
3727 locksmith, there's one about a mile from here.  But avast!" putting
3728 her hand in her side-pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess;
3729 let's see."  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!
3730 Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.
3731 
3732 "Have to burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry a
3733 little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again
3734 vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and
3735 with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.
3736 
3737 With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
3738 against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
3739 heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected;
3740 right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding
3741 Yojo on top of his head.  He looked neither one way nor the other
3742 way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.
3743 
3744 "Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the matter
3745 with you?"
3746 
3747 "He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?" said the landlady.
3748 
3749 But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
3750 like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was
3751 almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally
3752 constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so
3753 for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular
3754 meals.
3755 
3756 "Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you
3757 please, and I will see to this strange affair myself."
3758 
3759 Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
3760 Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat; and all he
3761 could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move
3762 a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my
3763 presence in the slightest way.
3764 
3765 I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;
3766 do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.  It must be
3767 so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him
3768 rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can't last for
3769 ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't
3770 believe it's very punctual then.
3771 
3772 I went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the
3773 long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding
3774 voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a
3775 schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic
3776 Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly
3777 eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by
3778 this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a
3779 termination.  But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had
3780 not stirred an inch.  I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so
3781 downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half
3782 the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his
3783 head.
3784 
3785 "For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and
3786 have some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg."
3787 But not a word did he reply.
3788 
3789 Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
3790 and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.  But previous
3791 to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over
3792 him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but
3793 his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could
3794 not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the
3795 mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that
3796 uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me
3797 really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room
3798 with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable
3799 Ramadan!
3800 
3801 But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break
3802 of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as
3803 if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first
3804 glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating
3805 joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;
3806 pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was
3807 over.
3808 
3809 Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's
3810 religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or
3811 insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it
3812 also.  But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a
3813 positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an
3814 uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that
3815 individual aside and argue the point with him.
3816 
3817 And just so I now did with Queequeg.  "Queequeg," said I, "get into
3818 bed now, and lie and listen to me."  I then went on, beginning with
3819 the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to
3820 the various religions of the present time, during which time I
3821 labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and
3822 prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark
3823 nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in
3824 short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,
3825 too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and
3826 sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now
3827 so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,
3828 argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;
3829 and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.
3830 This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such
3831 melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,
3832 said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an
3833 undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the
3834 hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.
3835 
3836 I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
3837 dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
3838 in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a
3839 great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great
3840 battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two
3841 o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.
3842 
3843 "No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "that will do;" for I knew
3844 the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor
3845 who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the
3846 custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all
3847 the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,
3848 they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like
3849 a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in
3850 their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all
3851 his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas
3852 turkeys.
3853 
3854 After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
3855 impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow
3856 seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
3857 from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more
3858 than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
3859 finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
3860 religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending
3861 concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that
3862 such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical
3863 pagan piety.
3864 
3865 At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously
3866 hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady
3867 should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out
3868 to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with
3869 halibut bones.
3870 
3871 
3872 
3873 CHAPTER 18
3874 
3875 His Mark.
3876 
3877 
3878 As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,
3879 Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice
3880 loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my
3881 friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no
3882 cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their
3883 papers.
3884 
3885 "What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on the
3886 bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
3887 
3888 "I mean," he replied, "he must show his papers."
3889 
3890 "Yes," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head
3891 from behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam.  "He must show that he's
3892 converted.  Son of darkness," he added, turning to Queequeg, "art
3893 thou at present in communion with any Christian church?"
3894 
3895 "Why," said I, "he's a member of the first Congregational Church."
3896 Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket
3897 ships at last come to be converted into the churches.
3898 
3899 "First Congregational Church," cried Bildad, "what! that worships in
3900 Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?" and so saying, taking
3901 out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
3902 handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
3903 wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look
3904 at Queequeg.
3905 
3906 "How long hath he been a member?" he then said, turning to me; "not
3907 very long, I rather guess, young man."
3908 
3909 "No," said Peleg, "and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it
3910 would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face."
3911 
3912 "Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this Philistine a regular member of
3913 Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting?  I never saw him going there, and I
3914 pass it every Lord's day."
3915 
3916 "I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," said
3917 I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
3918 Congregational Church.  He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."
3919 
3920 "Young man," said Bildad sternly, "thou art skylarking with
3921 me--explain thyself, thou young Hittite.  What church dost thee mean?
3922 answer me."
3923 
3924 Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied.  "I mean, sir, the same
3925 ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
3926 and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of
3927 us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
3928 worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish
3929 some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we
3930 all join hands."
3931 
3932 "Splice, thou mean'st SPLICE hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
3933 "Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary, instead of a
3934 fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.  Deacon
3935 Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it, and he's
3936 reckoned something.  Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the
3937 papers.  I say, tell Quohog there--what's that you call him? tell
3938 Quohog to step along.  By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got
3939 there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right.  I
3940 say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head
3941 of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?"
3942 
3943 Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
3944 the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
3945 hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
3946 harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--
3947 
3948 "Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere?  You see him?
3949 well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!" and taking sharp aim at
3950 it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean
3951 across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of
3952 sight.
3953 
3954 "Now," said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, "spos-ee him
3955 whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead."
3956 
3957 "Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
3958 vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
3959 gangway.  "Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers.  We
3960 must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.  Look
3961 ye, Quohog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more than
3962 ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket."
3963 
3964 So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
3965 enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.
3966 
3967 When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready
3968 for signing, he turned to me and said, "I guess, Quohog there don't
3969 know how to write, does he?  I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign
3970 thy name or make thy mark?
3971 
3972 But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
3973 part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
3974 offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
3975 counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm;
3976 so that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his
3977 appellative, it stood something like this:--
3978 
3979 Quohog.
3980 his X mark.
3981 
3982 Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing
3983 Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge
3984 pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts,
3985 and selecting one entitled "The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to
3986 Lose," placed it in Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the
3987 book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, "Son of
3988 darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship,
3989 and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still
3990 clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee,
3991 remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.  Spurn the idol Bell, and the
3992 hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say;
3993 oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!"
3994 
3995 Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,
3996 heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
3997 
3998 "Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our
3999 harpooneer," Peleg.  "Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--it
4000 takes the shark out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint
4001 pretty sharkish.  There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest
4002 boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the
4003 meeting, and never came to good.  He got so frightened about his
4004 plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear
4005 of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones."
4006 
4007 "Peleg!  Peleg!" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, "thou
4008 thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,
4009 Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou
4010 prate in this ungodly guise.  Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg.
4011 Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in
4012 that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with
4013 Captain Ahab, did'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?"
4014 
4015 "Hear him, hear him now," cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
4016 thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--"hear him, all of ye.
4017 Think of that!  When every moment we thought the ship would sink!
4018 Death and the Judgment then?  What?  With all three masts making such
4019 an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking
4020 over us, fore and aft.  Think of Death and the Judgment then?  No!
4021 no time to think about Death then.  Life was what Captain Ahab and I
4022 was thinking of; and how to save all hands--how to rig
4023 jury-masts--how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was
4024 thinking of."
4025 
4026 Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,
4027 where we followed him.  There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
4028 sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.  Now and then he
4029 stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
4030 otherwise might have been wasted.
4031 
4032 
4033 
4034 CHAPTER 19
4035 
4036 The Prophet.
4037 
4038 
4039 "Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?"
4040 
4041 Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
4042 the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when
4043 the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
4044 levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.  He was
4045 but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag
4046 of a black handkerchief investing his neck.  A confluent small-pox
4047 had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the
4048 complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have
4049 been dried up.
4050 
4051 "Have ye shipped in her?" he repeated.
4052 
4053 "You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose," said I, trying to gain a
4054 little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
4055 
4056 "Aye, the Pequod--that ship there," he said, drawing back his whole
4057 arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the
4058 fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
4059 
4060 "Yes," said I, "we have just signed the articles."
4061 
4062 "Anything down there about your souls?"
4063 
4064 "About what?"
4065 
4066 "Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any," he said quickly.  "No matter
4067 though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got any,--good luck to 'em;
4068 and they are all the better off for it.  A soul's a sort of a fifth
4069 wheel to a wagon."
4070 
4071 "What are you jabbering about, shipmate?" said I.
4072 
4073 "HE'S got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
4074 sort in other chaps," abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous
4075 emphasis upon the word HE.
4076 
4077 "Queequeg," said I, "let's go; this fellow has broken loose from
4078 somewhere; he's talking about something and somebody we don't know."
4079 
4080 "Stop!" cried the stranger.  "Ye said true--ye hav'n't seen Old
4081 Thunder yet, have ye?"
4082 
4083 "Who's Old Thunder?" said I, again riveted with the insane
4084 earnestness of his manner.
4085 
4086 "Captain Ahab."
4087 
4088 "What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?"
4089 
4090 "Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.  Ye
4091 hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"
4092 
4093 "No, we hav'n't.  He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will
4094 be all right again before long."
4095 
4096 "All right again before long!" laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
4097 derisive sort of laugh.  "Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right,
4098 then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."
4099 
4100 "What do you know about him?"
4101 
4102 "What did they TELL you about him?  Say that!"
4103 
4104 "They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that
4105 he's a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew."
4106 
4107 "That's true, that's true--yes, both true enough.  But you must jump
4108 when he gives an order.  Step and growl; growl and go--that's the
4109 word with Captain Ahab.  But nothing about that thing that happened
4110 to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days
4111 and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard
4112 afore the altar in Santa?--heard nothing about that, eh?  Nothing
4113 about the silver calabash he spat into?  And nothing about his losing
4114 his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.  Didn't ye hear a
4115 word about them matters and something more, eh?  No, I don't think ye
4116 did; how could ye?  Who knows it?  Not all Nantucket, I guess.  But
4117 hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell about the leg, and how he lost
4118 it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.  Oh yes, THAT every one
4119 knows a'most--I mean they know he's only one leg; and that a
4120 parmacetti took the other off."
4121 
4122 "My friend," said I, "what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
4123 don't know, and I don't much care; for it seems to me that you must
4124 be a little damaged in the head.  But if you are speaking of Captain
4125 Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I
4126 know all about the loss of his leg."
4127 
4128 "ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?"
4129 
4130 "Pretty sure."
4131 
4132 With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
4133 stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
4134 little, turned and said:--"Ye've shipped, have ye?  Names down on the
4135 papers?  Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will
4136 be; and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all.  Anyhow, it's
4137 all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go
4138 with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em!
4139 Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye;
4140 I'm sorry I stopped ye."
4141 
4142 "Look here, friend," said I, "if you have anything important to tell
4143 us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
4144 mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say."
4145 
4146 "And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
4147 you are just the man for him--the likes of ye.  Morning to ye,
4148 shipmates, morning!  Oh! when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded
4149 not to make one of 'em."
4150 
4151 "Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way--you can't fool us.
4152 It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
4153 great secret in him."
4154 
4155 "Morning to ye, shipmates, morning."
4156 
4157 "Morning it is," said I.  "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this
4158 crazy man.  But stop, tell me your name, will you?"
4159 
4160 "Elijah."
4161 
4162 Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
4163 other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
4164 nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.  But we had not gone
4165 perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
4166 looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
4167 though at a distance.  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
4168 said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
4169 comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same
4170 corner that we did.  He did; and then it seemed to me that he was
4171 dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me
4172 imagine.  This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,
4173 half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me
4174 all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all
4175 connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost;
4176 and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain
4177 Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the
4178 prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves
4179 to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.
4180 
4181 I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was
4182 really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with
4183 Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.  But Elijah
4184 passed on, without seeming to notice us.  This relieved me; and once
4185 more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a
4186 humbug.
4187 
4188 
4189 
4190 CHAPTER 20
4191 
4192 All Astir.
4193 
4194 
4195 A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
4196 Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming
4197 on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short,
4198 everything betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a
4199 close.  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his
4200 wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the
4201 purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the
4202 hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.
4203 
4204 On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given
4205 at all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their
4206 chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how
4207 soon the vessel might be sailing.  So Queequeg and I got down our
4208 traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last.  But it
4209 seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship
4210 did not sail for several days.  But no wonder; there was a good deal
4211 to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of,
4212 before the Pequod was fully equipped.
4213 
4214 Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives
4215 and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not,
4216 are indispensable to the business of housekeeping.  Just so with
4217 whaling, which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide
4218 ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and
4219 bankers.  And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet
4220 not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen.  For besides
4221 the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles
4222 peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of
4223 replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be
4224 remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed
4225 to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss
4226 of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
4227 Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons,
4228 and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate
4229 ship.
4230 
4231 At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of
4232 the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread,
4233 water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.  But, as before hinted, for
4234 some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of
4235 divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.
4236 
4237 Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
4238 Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and
4239 indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed
4240 resolved that, if SHE could help it, nothing should be found wanting
4241 in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea.  At one time she
4242 would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry;
4243 another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk, where
4244 he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of
4245 some one's rheumatic back.  Never did any woman better deserve her
4246 name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.  And
4247 like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle
4248 about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to
4249 anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to
4250 all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was
4251 concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
4252 well-saved dollars.
4253 
4254 But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming
4255 on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand,
4256 and a still longer whaling lance in the other.  Nor was Bildad himself
4257 nor Captain Peleg at all backward.  As for Bildad, he carried about
4258 with him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh
4259 arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.
4260 Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den,
4261 roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at
4262 the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.
4263 
4264 During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
4265 craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and
4266 when he was going to come on board his ship.  To these questions they
4267 would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected
4268 aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could
4269 attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage.  If
4270 I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very
4271 plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this
4272 way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who
4273 was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out
4274 upon the open sea.  But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes
4275 happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly
4276 strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.  And much this
4277 way it was with me.  I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
4278 
4279 At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
4280 certainly sail.  So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early
4281 start.
4282 
4283 
4284 
4285 CHAPTER 21
4286 
4287 Going Aboard.
4288 
4289 
4290 It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when
4291 we drew nigh the wharf.
4292 
4293 "There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right," said I
4294 to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess;
4295 come on!"
4296 
4297 "Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
4298 behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
4299 himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
4300 twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.  It was Elijah.
4301 
4302 "Going aboard?"
4303 
4304 "Hands off, will you," said I.
4305 
4306 "Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"
4307 
4308 "Ain't going aboard, then?"
4309 
4310 "Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours?  Do you
4311 know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"
4312 
4313 "No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and
4314 wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
4315 glances.
4316 
4317 "Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.
4318 We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not
4319 to be detained."
4320 
4321 "Ye be, be ye?  Coming back afore breakfast?"
4322 
4323 "He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."
4324 
4325 "Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a
4326 few paces.
4327 
4328 "Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."
4329 
4330 But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
4331 shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards
4332 that ship a while ago?"
4333 
4334 Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,
4335 "Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be
4336 sure."
4337 
4338 "Very dim, very dim," said Elijah.  "Morning to ye."
4339 
4340 Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
4341 touching my shoulder again, said, "See if you can find 'em now, will
4342 ye?
4343 
4344 "Find who?"
4345 
4346 "Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off.  "Oh!
4347 I was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all
4348 one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it?
4349 Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's
4350 before the Grand Jury."  And with these cracked words he finally
4351 departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his
4352 frantic impudence.
4353 
4354 At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in
4355 profound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked
4356 within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.
4357 Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle
4358 open.  Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger
4359 there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.  He was thrown at whole
4360 length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded
4361 arms.  The profoundest slumber slept upon him.
4362 
4363 "Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said
4364 I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that, when on the
4365 wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
4366 would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
4367 matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.
4368 But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly
4369 hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;
4370 telling him to establish himself accordingly.  He put his hand upon
4371 the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and
4372 then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.
4373 
4374 "Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit there," said I.
4375 
4376 "Oh! perry dood seat," said Queequeg, "my country way; won't hurt
4377 him face."
4378 
4379 "Face!" said I, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance
4380 then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,
4381 Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.  Get
4382 off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off soon.  I wonder he don't
4383 wake."
4384 
4385 Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
4386 lighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.  We kept the pipe
4387 passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon
4388 questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand
4389 that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all
4390 sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the
4391 custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to
4392 furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up
4393 eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and
4394 alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much
4395 better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into
4396 walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
4397 desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,
4398 perhaps in some damp marshy place.
4399 
4400 While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the
4401 tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the
4402 sleeper's head.
4403 
4404 "What's that for, Queequeg?"
4405 
4406 "Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!
4407 
4408 He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
4409 which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and
4410 soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping
4411 rigger.  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole,
4412 it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;
4413 then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;
4414 then sat up and rubbed his eyes.
4415 
4416 "Holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye smokers?"
4417 
4418 "Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"
4419 
4420 "Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?  She sails to-day.  The
4421 Captain came aboard last night."
4422 
4423 "What Captain?--Ahab?"
4424 
4425 "Who but him indeed?"
4426 
4427 I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when
4428 we heard a noise on deck.
4429 
4430 "Holloa!  Starbuck's astir," said the rigger.  "He's a lively chief
4431 mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn
4432 to."  And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.
4433 
4434 It was now clear sunrise.  Soon the crew came on board in twos and
4435 threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
4436 engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing
4437 various last things on board.  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained
4438 invisibly enshrined within his cabin.
4439 
4440 
4441 
4442 CHAPTER 22
4443 
4444 Merry Christmas.
4445 
4446 
4447 At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's
4448 riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
4449 after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
4450 her last gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her
4451 brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward--after all this,
4452 the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and
4453 turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
4454 
4455 "Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?  Captain Ahab
4456 is all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore,
4457 eh?  Well, call all hands, then.  Muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!"
4458 
4459 "No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said
4460 Bildad, "but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding."
4461 
4462 How now!  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,
4463 Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on
4464 the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,
4465 as well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no
4466 sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.
4467 But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary
4468 in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.
4469 Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;
4470 and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,
4471 Captain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;
4472 especially as in the merchant service many captains never show
4473 themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the
4474 anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell
4475 merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for
4476 good with the pilot.
4477 
4478 But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
4479 Peleg was now all alive.  He seemed to do most of the talking and
4480 commanding, and not Bildad.
4481 
4482 "Aft here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as the sailors lingered
4483 at the main-mast.  "Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft."
4484 
4485 "Strike the tent there!"--was the next order.  As I hinted before,
4486 this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board
4487 the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well
4488 known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
4489 
4490 "Man the capstan!  Blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command,
4491 and the crew sprang for the handspikes.
4492 
4493 Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the
4494 pilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad, who, with
4495 Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the
4496 licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself
4497 made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the
4498 ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other
4499 craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking
4500 over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing
4501 what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the
4502 windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in
4503 Booble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not three days
4504 previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed
4505 on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and
4506 Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each
4507 seaman's berth.
4508 
4509 Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped
4510 and swore astern in the most frightful manner.  I almost thought he
4511 would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily
4512 I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking
4513 of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a
4514 devil for a pilot.  I was comforting myself, however, with the
4515 thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of
4516 his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp
4517 poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition
4518 of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate
4519 vicinity.  That was my first kick.
4520 
4521 "Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?" he roared.
4522 "Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!  Why don't
4523 ye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!  Quohog! spring, thou chap with
4524 the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green
4525 pants.  Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!"  And so
4526 saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg
4527 very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his
4528 psalmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something
4529 to-day.
4530 
4531 At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.  It
4532 was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged
4533 into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,
4534 whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.  The long
4535 rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like
4536 the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles
4537 depended from the bows.
4538 
4539 Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
4540 the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
4541 frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his
4542 steady notes were heard,--
4543 
4544 "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
4545 Stand dressed in living green.
4546 So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
4547 While Jordan rolled between."
4548 
4549 
4550 Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.  They
4551 were full of hope and fruition.  Spite of this frigid winter night in
4552 the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket,
4553 there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;
4554 and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by
4555 the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
4556 
4557 At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
4558 longer.  The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
4559 alongside.
4560 
4561 It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected
4562 at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.  For loath to depart,
4563 yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and
4564 perilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some
4565 thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which
4566 an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once
4567 more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath
4568 to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to
4569 him,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious
4570 strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word
4571 there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the
4572 wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern
4573 Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and
4574 left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically
4575 coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the
4576 hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically
4577 in his face, as much as to say, "Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can
4578 stand it; yes, I can."
4579 
4580 As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
4581 his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the
4582 lantern came too near.  And he, too, did not a little run from cabin
4583 to deck--now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief
4584 mate.
4585 
4586 But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look
4587 about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.  Back
4588 the main-yard there!  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to come close alongside,
4589 now!  Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last.  Luck to
4590 ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye
4591 and good luck to ye all--and this day three years I'll have a hot
4592 supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket.  Hurrah and away!"
4593 
4594 "God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," murmured old
4595 Bildad, almost incoherently.  "I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so
4596 that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all
4597 he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.
4598 Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.  Don't stave the boats needlessly,
4599 ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
4600 within the year.  Don't forget your prayers, either.  Mr. Starbuck,
4601 mind that cooper don't waste the spare staves.  Oh! the sail-needles
4602 are in the green locker!  Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days,
4603 men; but don't miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's
4604 good gifts.  Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a
4605 little leaky, I thought.  If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask,
4606 beware of fornication.  Good-bye, good-bye!  Don't keep that cheese
4607 too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it'll spoil.  Be careful
4608 with the butter--twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if--"
4609 
4610 "Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away!" and with that,
4611 Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
4612 
4613 Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
4614 screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
4615 three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the
4616 lone Atlantic.

4620 CHAPTER 23
4621 
4622 The Lee Shore.
4623 
4624 
4625 Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
4626 mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
4627 
4628 When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her
4629 vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see
4630 standing at her helm but Bulkington!  I looked with sympathetic awe
4631 and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a
4632 four years' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for
4633 still another tempestuous term.  The land seemed scorching to his
4634 feet.  Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories
4635 yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of
4636 Bulkington.  Let me only say that it fared with him as with the
4637 storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.  The
4638 port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is
4639 safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all
4640 that's kind to our mortalities.  But in that gale, the port, the
4641 land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality;
4642 one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her
4643 shudder through and through.  With all her might she crowds all sail
4644 off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would
4645 blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for
4646 refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her
4647 bitterest foe!
4648 
4649 Know ye now, Bulkington?  Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
4650 intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the
4651 intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea;
4652 while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on
4653 the treacherous, slavish shore?
4654 
4655 But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
4656 indefinite as God--so, better is it to perish in that howling
4657 infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were
4658 safety!  For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land!
4659 Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain?  Take heart, take
4660 heart, O Bulkington!  Bear thee grimly, demigod!  Up from the spray
4661 of thy ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!
4662 
4663 
4664 
4665 CHAPTER 24
4666 
4667 The Advocate.
4668 
4669 
4670 As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of
4671 whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be
4672 regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable
4673 pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of
4674 the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.
4675 
4676 In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
4677 the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
4678 accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.
4679 If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan
4680 society, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his
4681 merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if
4682 in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials
4683 S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure
4684 would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.
4685 
4686 Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
4687 whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to
4688 a butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged
4689 therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.  Butchers we
4690 are, that is true.  But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest
4691 badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably
4692 delights to honour.  And as for the matter of the alleged
4693 uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into
4694 certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the
4695 whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among
4696 the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.  But even granting the
4697 charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a
4698 whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
4699 battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all
4700 ladies' plaudits?  And if the idea of peril so much enhances the
4701 popular conceit of the soldier's profession; let me assure ye that
4702 many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly
4703 recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into
4704 eddies the air over his head.  For what are the comprehensible
4705 terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of
4706 God!
4707 
4708 But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
4709 unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
4710 adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
4711 round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!
4712 
4713 But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
4714 scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.
4715 
4716 Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their whaling
4717 fleets?  Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense,
4718 fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town
4719 some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket?  Why
4720 did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in
4721 bounties upwards of L1,000,000?  And lastly, how comes it that we
4722 whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen
4723 in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned
4724 by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the
4725 ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year
4726 importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000.  How
4727 comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?
4728 
4729 But this is not the half; look again.
4730 
4731 I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his
4732 life, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last
4733 sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world,
4734 taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.
4735 One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in
4736 themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues,
4737 that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore
4738 offspring themselves pregnant from her womb.  It would be a hopeless,
4739 endless task to catalogue all these things.  Let a handful suffice.
4740 For many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting
4741 out the remotest and least known parts of the earth.  She has
4742 explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or
4743 Vancouver had ever sailed.  If American and European men-of-war
4744 now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to
4745 the honour and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them
4746 the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.  They
4747 may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your
4748 Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous
4749 Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and
4750 greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.  For in their
4751 succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,
4752 and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with
4753 virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and
4754 muskets would not willingly have dared.  All that is made such a
4755 flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
4756 life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers.  Often,
4757 adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men
4758 accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship's common log.  Ah,
4759 the world!  Oh, the world!
4760 
4761 Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
4762 scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe
4763 and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific
4764 coast.  It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous
4765 policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space
4766 permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at
4767 last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the
4768 yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in
4769 those parts.
4770 
4771 That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was
4772 given to the enlightened world by the whaleman.  After its first
4773 blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned
4774 those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched
4775 there.  The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
4776 Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the
4777 emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent
4778 biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
4779 The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do
4780 commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the
4781 missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive
4782 missionaries to their first destinations.  If that double-bolted
4783 land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone
4784 to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.
4785 
4786 But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has
4787 no aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I
4788 ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a
4789 split helmet every time.
4790 
4791 The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
4792 will say.
4793 
4794 THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?  Who
4795 wrote the first account of our Leviathan?  Who but mighty Job!  And
4796 who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage?  Who, but no
4797 less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen,
4798 took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those
4799 times!  And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament?  Who,
4800 but Edmund Burke!
4801 
4802 True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have
4803 no good blood in their veins.
4804 
4805 NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?  They have something better than royal
4806 blood there.  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;
4807 afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of
4808 Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and
4809 harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the
4810 barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.
4811 
4812 Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
4813 respectable.
4814 
4815 WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?  Whaling is imperial!  By old English
4816 statutory law, the whale is declared "a royal fish."*
4817 
4818 Oh, that's only nominal!  The whale himself has never figured in any
4819 grand imposing way.
4820 
4821 THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY?  In one of the
4822 mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the
4823 world's capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the
4824 Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed
4825 procession.*
4826 
4827 
4828 *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
4829 
4830 
4831 Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
4832 dignity in whaling.
4833 
4834 NO DIGNITY IN WHALING?  The dignity of our calling the very heavens
4835 attest.  Cetus is a constellation in the South!  No more!  Drive
4836 down your hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg!
4837 No more!  I know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred
4838 and fifty whales.  I account that man more honourable than that great
4839 captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.
4840 
4841 And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet
4842 undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real
4843 repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be
4844 unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon
4845 the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone; if,
4846 at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any
4847 precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the
4848 honour and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College
4849 and my Harvard.

4854 
4855 Postscript.
4856 
4857 
4858 In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
4859 substantiated facts.  But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
4860 should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
4861 eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be
4862 blameworthy?
4863 
4864 It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
4865 modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their
4866 functions is gone through.  There is a saltcellar of state, so
4867 called, and there may be a castor of state.  How they use the salt,
4868 precisely--who knows?  Certain I am, however, that a king's head is
4869 solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.  Can it
4870 be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior
4871 run well, as they anoint machinery?  Much might be ruminated here,
4872 concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
4873 common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who
4874 anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.  In truth, a
4875 mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has
4876 probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.  As a general rule, he
4877 can't amount to much in his totality.
4878 
4879 But the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil
4880 is used at coronations?  Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor
4881 macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor
4882 cod-liver oil.  What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in
4883 its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
4884 
4885 Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
4886 queens with coronation stuff!

4891 
4892 Knights and Squires.
4893 
4894 
4895 The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and
4896 a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on
4897 an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh
4898 being hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his
4899 live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born
4900 in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast
4901 days for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers
4902 had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical
4903 superfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more
4904 the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the
4905 indication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of
4906 the man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His
4907 pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,
4908 and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified
4909 Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to
4910 come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid
4911 sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted
4912 to do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to
4913 see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
4914 had calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose
4915 life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a
4916 tame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and
4917 fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times
4918 affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the
4919 rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep
4920 natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did
4921 therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of
4922 superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,
4923 somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and
4924 inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the
4925 welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories
4926 of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from
4927 the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to
4928 those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain
4929 the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more
4930 perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  "I will have no man in my
4931 boat," said Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale."  By this, he
4932 seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage
4933 was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered
4934 peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous
4935 comrade than a coward.
4936 
4937 "Aye, aye," said Stubb, the second mate, "Starbuck, there, is as
4938 careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery."  But we shall
4939 ere long see what that word "careful" precisely means when used by a
4940 man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.
4941 
4942 Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
4943 sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
4944 all mortally practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that
4945 in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple
4946 outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be
4947 foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales
4948 after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much
4949 persisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this
4950 critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by
4951 them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck
4952 well knew.  What doom was his own father's?  Where, in the bottomless
4953 deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?
4954 
4955 With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
4956 superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck
4957 which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been
4958 extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so
4959 organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he
4960 had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently
4961 engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,
4962 would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.
4963 And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,
4964 visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in
4965 the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary
4966 irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more
4967 terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you
4968 from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.
4969 
4970 But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
4971 abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart
4972 to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to
4973 expose the fall of valour in the soul.  Men may seem detestable as
4974 joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there
4975 may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal,
4976 is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that
4977 over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to
4978 throw their costliest robes.  That immaculate manliness we feel
4979 within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all
4980 the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the
4981 undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at
4982 such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the
4983 permitting stars.  But this august dignity I treat of, is not the
4984 dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no
4985 robed investiture.  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields
4986 a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all
4987 hands, radiates without end from God; Himself!  The great God
4988 absolute!  The centre and circumference of all democracy!  His
4989 omnipresence, our divine equality!
4990 
4991 If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
4992 hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them
4993 tragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased,
4994 among them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if
4995 I shall touch that workman's arm with some ethereal light; if I shall
4996 spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all
4997 mortal critics bear me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality,
4998 which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind!
4999 Bear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to
5000 the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst
5001 clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and
5002 paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson
5003 from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst
5004 thunder him higher than a throne!  Thou who, in all Thy mighty,
5005 earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the
5006 kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!

5010 CHAPTER 27
5011 
5012 Knights and Squires.
5013 
5014 
5015 Stubb was the second mate.  He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
5016 according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man.  A
5017 happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they
5018 came with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent
5019 crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman
5020 joiner engaged for the year.  Good-humored, easy, and careless, he
5021 presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but
5022 a dinner, and his crew all invited guests.  He was as particular
5023 about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an
5024 old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.  When close to the
5025 whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying
5026 lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.  He
5027 would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the
5028 most exasperated monster.  Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted
5029 the jaws of death into an easy chair.  What he thought of death
5030 itself, there is no telling.  Whether he ever thought of it at all,
5031 might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that
5032 way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took
5033 it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir
5034 themselves there, about something which he would find out when he
5035 obeyed the order, and not sooner.
5036 
5037 What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
5038 unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
5039 world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their
5040 packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of
5041 his; that thing must have been his pipe.  For, like his nose, his
5042 short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.
5043 You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk
5044 without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes
5045 there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;
5046 and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,
5047 lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading
5048 them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead
5049 of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his
5050 mouth.
5051 
5052 I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of
5053 his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
5054 whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
5055 miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as
5056 in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
5057 handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
5058 tribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
5059 disinfecting agent.
5060 
5061 The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard.
5062 A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning
5063 whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had
5064 personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a
5065 sort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever
5066 encountered.  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for
5067 the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead
5068 to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from
5069 encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was
5070 but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring
5071 only a little circumvention and some small application of time and
5072 trouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious
5073 fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of
5074 whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years'
5075 voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length
5076 of time.  As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and
5077 cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one
5078 of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called
5079 him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be
5080 well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic
5081 whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
5082 inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy
5083 concussions of those battering seas.
5084 
5085 Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
5086 men.  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
5087 Pequod's boats as headsmen.  In that grand order of battle in which
5088 Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
5089 whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.  Or,
5090 being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a
5091 picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of
5092 javelins.
5093 
5094 And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a
5095 Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or
5096 harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh
5097 lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the
5098 assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a
5099 close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in
5100 this place we set down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what
5101 headsman each of them belonged.
5102 
5103 First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had
5104 selected for his squire.  But Queequeg is already known.
5105 
5106 Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
5107 promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last
5108 remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
5109 neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
5110 harpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
5111 Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek
5112 bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their
5113 largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this
5114 sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of
5115 those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England
5116 moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.
5117 But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
5118 woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the
5119 sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible
5120 arrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky
5121 limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
5122 the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son
5123 of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the
5124 second mate's squire.
5125 
5126 Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
5127 negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.
5128 Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the
5129 sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the
5130 top-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily
5131 shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native
5132 coast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,
5133 Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and
5134 having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the
5135 ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they
5136 shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a
5137 giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in
5138 his socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and
5139 a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce
5140 of a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus
5141 Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man
5142 beside him.  As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,
5143 that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men
5144 before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans
5145 born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.  Herein it is the
5146 same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and
5147 military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in
5148 the construction of the American Canals and Railroads.  The same, I
5149 say, because in all these cases the native American liberally
5150 provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying
5151 the muscles.  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the
5152 Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
5153 augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.
5154 In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London,
5155 put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of
5156 their crew.  Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again.
5157 How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best
5158 whalemen.  They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, ISOLATOES
5159 too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but
5160 each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own.  Yet now,
5161 federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!  An
5162 Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all
5163 the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the
5164 world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them
5165 ever come back.  Black Little Pip--he never did--oh, no! he went
5166 before.  Poor Alabama boy!  On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall
5167 ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal
5168 time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid
5169 strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a
5170 coward here, hailed a hero there!
5171 
5172 
5173 
5174 CHAPTER 28
5175 
5176 Ahab.
5177 
5178 
5179 For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
5180 seen of Captain Ahab.  The mates regularly relieved each other at the
5181 watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they
5182 seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes
5183 issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that
5184 after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.  Yes, their
5185 supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any
5186 eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the
5187 cabin.
5188 
5189 Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
5190 gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first
5191 vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion
5192 of the sea, became almost a perturbation.  This was strangely
5193 heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences
5194 uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have
5195 before conceived of.  But poorly could I withstand them, much as in
5196 other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities
5197 of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.  But whatever it was of
5198 apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet
5199 whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all
5200 warrantry to cherish such emotions.  For though the harpooneers, with
5201 the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and
5202 motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my
5203 previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed
5204 this--and rightly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very
5205 nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so
5206 abandonedly embarked.  But it was especially the aspect of the three
5207 chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly
5208 calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence
5209 and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.  Three better,
5210 more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,
5211 could not readily be found, and they were every one of them
5212 Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, it being
5213 Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
5214 biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the
5215 southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
5216 sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its
5217 intolerable weather behind us.  It was one of those less lowering,
5218 but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when
5219 with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a
5220 vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted
5221 to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled
5222 my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.
5223 Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his
5224 quarter-deck.
5225 
5226 There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
5227 recovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away from the stake,
5228 when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without
5229 consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged
5230 robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,
5231 and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus.
5232 Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right
5233 down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it
5234 disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly
5235 whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the
5236 straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning
5237 tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels
5238 and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the
5239 soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether
5240 that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some
5241 desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,
5242 throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,
5243 especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head
5244 Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was
5245 full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it
5246 came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an
5247 elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially
5248 negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
5249 who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this
5250 laid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the
5251 immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with
5252 preternatural powers of discernment.  So that no white sailor
5253 seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab
5254 should be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he
5255 muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,
5256 would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
5257 
5258 So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the
5259 livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I
5260 hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing
5261 to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had
5262 previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned
5263 from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.  "Aye, he was
5264 dismasted off Japan," said the old Gay-Head Indian once; "but like
5265 his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for
5266 it.  He has a quiver of 'em."
5267 
5268 I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side
5269 of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
5270 there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the
5271 plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and
5272 holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out
5273 beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of
5274 firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the
5275 fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he
5276 spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their
5277 minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if
5278 not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And
5279 not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a
5280 crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing
5281 dignity of some mighty woe.
5282 
5283 Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his
5284 cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;
5285 either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he
5286 had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;
5287 indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less
5288 a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the
5289 dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,
5290 by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the
5291 air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at
5292 last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But
5293 the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;
5294 nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were
5295 fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of
5296 himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that
5297 one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his
5298 brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves
5299 upon.
5300 
5301 Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
5302 pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
5303 from his mood.  For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April
5304 and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the
5305 barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send
5306 forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants;
5307 so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of
5308 that girlish air.  More than once did he put forth the faint blossom
5309 of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a
5310 smile.
5311 
5312 
5313 
5314 CHAPTER 29
5315 
5316 Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
5317 
5318 
5319 Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now
5320 went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
5321 perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the
5322 Tropic.  The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
5323 redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
5324 up--flaked up, with rose-water snow.  The starred and stately nights
5325 seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
5326 pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden
5327 helmeted suns!  For sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such
5328 winsome days and such seducing nights.  But all the witcheries of
5329 that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to
5330 the outward world.  Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when
5331 the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals
5332 as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.  And all these
5333 subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.
5334 
5335 Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the
5336 less man has to do with aught that looks like death.  Among
5337 sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths
5338 to visit the night-cloaked deck.  It was so with Ahab; only that now,
5339 of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly
5340 speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to
5341 the planks.  "It feels like going down into one's tomb,"--he would
5342 mutter to himself--"for an old captain like me to be descending this
5343 narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth."
5344 
5345 So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night
5346 were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band
5347 below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the
5348 sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some
5349 cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their
5350 slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin
5351 to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the
5352 cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the
5353 iron banister, to help his crippled way.  Some considering touch of
5354 humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained
5355 from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
5356 seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have
5357 been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their
5358 dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks.  But once,
5359 the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with
5360 heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to
5361 mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a
5362 certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain
5363 Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but
5364 there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something
5365 indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion
5366 into it, of the ivory heel.  Ah!  Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
5367 then.
5368 
5369 "Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou wouldst wad me
5370 that fashion?  But go thy ways; I had forgot.  Below to thy nightly
5371 grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the
5372 filling one at last.--Down, dog, and kennel!"
5373 
5374 Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
5375 scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
5376 "I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
5377 like it, sir."
5378 
5379 "Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving
5380 away, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.
5381 
5382 "No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, emboldened, "I will not tamely be
5383 called a dog, sir."
5384 
5385 "Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and
5386 begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!"
5387 
5388 As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
5389 in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
5390 
5391 "I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,"
5392 muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.
5393 "It's very queer.  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know
5394 whether to go back and strike him, or--what's that?--down here on my
5395 knees and pray for him?  Yes, that was the thought coming up in me;
5396 but it would be the first time I ever DID pray.  It's queer; very
5397 queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the
5398 queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.  How he flashed at me!--his
5399 eyes like powder-pans! is he mad?  Anyway there's something on his
5400 mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.
5401 He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the
5402 twenty-four; and he don't sleep then.  Didn't that Dough-Boy, the
5403 steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's
5404 hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the
5405 foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort
5406 of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?  A hot old
5407 man!  I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's
5408 a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--worse nor a toothache.  Well, well;
5409 I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.  He's
5410 full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every
5411 night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should
5412 like to know?  Who's made appointments with him in the hold?  Ain't
5413 that queer, now?  But there's no telling, it's the old game--Here
5414 goes for a snooze.  Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born
5415 into the world, if only to fall right asleep.  And now that I think
5416 of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of
5417 queer, too.  Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em.
5418 But that's against my principles.  Think not, is my eleventh
5419 commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes
5420 again.  But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me
5421 ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT!  He
5422 might as well have kicked me, and done with it.  Maybe he DID kick
5423 me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow,
5424 somehow.  It flashed like a bleached bone.  What the devil's the
5425 matter with me?  I don't stand right on my legs.  Coming afoul of
5426 that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.  By the Lord, I
5427 must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?--but the only way's
5428 to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I'll
5429 see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight."
5430 
5431 
5432 
5433 CHAPTER 30
5434 
5435 The Pipe.
5436 
5437 
5438 When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
5439 bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
5440 sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
5441 his pipe.  Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the
5442 stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.
5443 
5444 In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
5445 fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.  How could
5446 one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
5447 bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?  For a Khan of the
5448 plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was
5449 Ahab.
5450 
5451 Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth
5452 in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.
5453 "How now," he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, "this
5454 smoking no longer soothes.  Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if
5455 thy charm be gone!  Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not
5456 pleasuring--aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to
5457 windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale,
5458 my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.  What
5459 business have I with this pipe?  This thing that is meant for
5460 sereneness, to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs, not
5461 among torn iron-grey locks like mine.  I'll smoke no more--"
5462 
5463 He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.  The fire hissed in
5464 the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking
5465 pipe made.  With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
5466 
5467 
5468 
5469 CHAPTER 31
5470 
5471 Queen Mab.
5472 
5473 
5474 Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
5475 
5476 "Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.  You know the old man's
5477 ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to
5478 kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off!
5479 And then, presto!  Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool,
5480 kept kicking at it.  But what was still more curious, Flask--you know
5481 how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I
5482 somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not
5483 much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.  'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the
5484 row?  It's not a real leg, only a false leg.'  And there's a mighty
5485 difference between a living thump and a dead thump.  That's what
5486 makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear
5487 than a blow from a cane.  The living member--that makes the living
5488 insult, my little man.  And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,
5489 while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so
5490 confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was
5491 thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but a cane--a whalebone
5492 cane.  Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact,
5493 only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base kick.  Besides,'
5494 thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a
5495 small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
5496 THERE'S a devilish broad insult.  But this insult is whittled down to
5497 a point only.'  But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.
5498 While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired
5499 old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and
5500 slews me round.  'What are you 'bout?' says he.  Slid! man, but I was
5501 frightened.  Such a phiz!  But, somehow, next moment I was over the
5502 fright.  'What am I about?' says I at last.  'And what business is
5503 that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback?  Do YOU want a
5504 kick?'  By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned
5505 round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
5506 had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man,
5507 his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out.  Says
5508 I, on second thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.'  'Wise
5509 Stubb,' said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a
5510 sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn't
5511 going to stop saying over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I
5512 might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.  But I had only just
5513 lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!'
5514 'Halloa,' says I, 'what's the matter now, old fellow?'  'Look ye
5515 here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult.  Captain Ahab kicked ye,
5516 didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,' says I--'right HERE it was.'  'Very
5517 good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg, didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,'
5518 says I.  'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have you to complain
5519 of?  Didn't he kick with right good will? it wasn't a common pitch
5520 pine leg he kicked with, was it?  No, you were kicked by a great man,
5521 and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.  It's an honour; I consider it
5522 an honour.  Listen, wise Stubb.  In old England the greatest lords
5523 think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made
5524 garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by
5525 old Ahab, and made a wise man of.  Remember what I say; BE kicked by
5526 him; account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you
5527 can't help yourself, wise Stubb.  Don't you see that pyramid?'  With
5528 that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
5529 swim off into the air.  I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my
5530 hammock!  Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?"
5531 
5532 "I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'"
5533 
5534 "May be; may be.  But it's made a wise man of me, Flask.  D'ye see
5535 Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?  Well, the best
5536 thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to
5537 him, whatever he says.  Halloa!  What's that he shouts?  Hark!"
5538 
5539 "Mast-head, there!  Look sharp, all of ye!  There are whales
5540 hereabouts!
5541 
5542 If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
5543 
5544 "What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of
5545 something queer about that, eh?  A white whale--did ye mark that,
5546 man?  Look ye--there's something special in the wind.  Stand by for
5547 it, Flask.  Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind.  But, mum; he
5548 comes this way."
5549 
5550 
5551 
5552 CHAPTER 32
5553 
5554 Cetology.
5555 
5556 
5557 Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be
5558 lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.  Ere that come to pass;
5559 ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled
5560 hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a
5561 matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding
5562 of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all
5563 sorts which are to follow.
5564 
5565 It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
5566 that I would now fain put before you.  Yet is it no easy task.  The
5567 classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
5568 essayed.  Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid
5569 down.
5570 
5571 "No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
5572 Cetology," says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
5573 
5574 "It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the
5575 inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and
5576 families....  Utter confusion exists among the historians of this
5577 animal" (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
5578 
5579 "Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters."
5580 "Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea."  "A field
5581 strewn with thorns."  "All these incomplete indications but serve to
5582 torture us naturalists."
5583 
5584 Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and
5585 Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.  Nevertheless, though of
5586 real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and
5587 so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.
5588 Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen,
5589 who have at large or in little, written of the whale.  Run over a
5590 few:--The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir
5591 Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;
5592 Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest;
5593 Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale;
5594 Bennett; J.  Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and
5595 the Rev.  T.  Cheever.  But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all
5596 these have written, the above cited extracts will show.
5597 
5598 Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
5599 ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
5600 harpooneer and whaleman.  I mean Captain Scoresby.  On the separate
5601 subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
5602 authority.  But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
5603 sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost
5604 unworthy mentioning.  And here be it said, that the Greenland whale
5605 is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.  He is not even by any
5606 means the largest of the whales.  Yet, owing to the long priority of
5607 his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years
5608 back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and
5609 which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few
5610 scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every
5611 way complete.  Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in
5612 the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland
5613 whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.  But
5614 the time has at last come for a new proclamation.  This is Charing
5615 Cross; hear ye! good people all,--the Greenland whale is
5616 deposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!
5617 
5618 There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
5619 living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest
5620 degree succeed in the attempt.  Those books are Beale's and
5621 Bennett's; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea
5622 whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.  The original matter
5623 touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily
5624 small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though
5625 mostly confined to scientific description.  As yet, however, the
5626 sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any
5627 literature.  Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten
5628 life.
5629 
5630 Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
5631 comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
5632 present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
5633 laborers.  As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
5634 hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.  I promise nothing complete;
5635 because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
5636 reason infallibly be faulty.  I shall not pretend to a minute
5637 anatomical description of the various species, or--in this place at
5638 least--to much of any description.  My object here is simply to
5639 project the draught of a systematization of cetology.  I am the
5640 architect, not the builder.
5641 
5642 But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
5643 Post-Office is equal to it.  To grope down into the bottom of the sea
5644 after them; to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations,
5645 ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing.  What am
5646 I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan!  The awful
5647 tauntings in Job might well appal me.  "Will he the (leviathan) make
5648 a covenant with thee?  Behold the hope of him is vain!  But I have
5649 swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do
5650 with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will
5651 try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.
5652 
5653 First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology
5654 is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters
5655 it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his
5656 System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separate
5657 the whales from the fish."  But of my own knowledge, I know that down
5658 to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against
5659 Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of
5660 the same seas with the Leviathan.
5661 
5662 The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales
5663 from the waters, he states as follows: "On account of their warm
5664 bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow
5665 ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem," and finally, "ex
5666 lege naturae jure meritoque."  I submitted all this to my friends
5667 Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine
5668 in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons
5669 set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted
5670 they were humbug.
5671 
5672 Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
5673 ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
5674 This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
5675 respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has
5676 given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm
5677 blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
5678 
5679 Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
5680 conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,
5681 a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have
5682 him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
5683 meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not
5684 a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the
5685 definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost
5686 any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have
5687 not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among
5688 spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably
5689 assumes a horizontal position.
5690 
5691 By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
5692 from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
5693 with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
5694 hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
5695 alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
5696 must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come
5697 the grand divisions of the entire whale host.
5698 
5699 
5700 *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins
5701 and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
5702 included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish
5703 are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of
5704 rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,
5705 I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with
5706 their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.
5707 
5708 
5709 First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary
5710 BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them
5711 all, both small and large.
5712 
5713 I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
5714 
5715 As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO,
5716 the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.
5717 
5718 FOLIOS.  Among these I here include the following chapters:--I. The
5719 SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the
5720 HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM
5721 WHALE.
5722 
5723 BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the
5724 English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter
5725 whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
5726 French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of
5727 the Long Words.  He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the
5728 globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most
5729 majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce;
5730 he being the only creature from which that valuable substance,
5731 spermaceti, is obtained.  All his peculiarities will, in many other
5732 places, be enlarged upon.  It is chiefly with his name that I now
5733 have to do.  Philologically considered, it is absurd.  Some centuries
5734 ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own
5735 proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained
5736 from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was
5737 popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the
5738 one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.  It was
5739 the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of
5740 the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally
5741 expresses.  In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,
5742 not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.  It
5743 was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of
5744 rhubarb.  When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of
5745 spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the
5746 dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely
5747 significant of its scarcity.  And so the appellation must at last
5748 have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti
5749 was really derived.
5750 
5751 BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is
5752 the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly
5753 hunted by man.  It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or
5754 baleen; and the oil specially known as "whale oil," an inferior
5755 article in commerce.  Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately
5756 designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland
5757 Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right
5758 Whale.  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the
5759 species thus multitudinously baptised.  What then is the whale, which
5760 I include in the second species of my Folios?  It is the Great
5761 Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the
5762 English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the
5763 Growlands Walfish of the Swedes.  It is the whale which for more than
5764 two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the
5765 Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long
5766 pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West
5767 Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right
5768 Whale Cruising Grounds.
5769 
5770 Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
5771 English and the right whale of the Americans.  But they precisely
5772 agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a
5773 single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.
5774 It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive
5775 differences, that some departments of natural history become so
5776 repellingly intricate.  The right whale will be elsewhere treated of
5777 at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.
5778 
5779 BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon a
5780 monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
5781 Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the
5782 whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing
5783 the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he
5784 attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,
5785 but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to
5786 olive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the
5787 intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand
5788 distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is
5789 often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet
5790 long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an
5791 angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the
5792 slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin
5793 will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When
5794 the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical
5795 ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon
5796 the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle
5797 surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy
5798 hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
5799 back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as
5800 some men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;
5801 unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen
5802 waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall
5803 misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous
5804 power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from
5805 man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his
5806 race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the
5807 baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the
5808 right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,
5809 that is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,
5810 there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are
5811 little known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed
5812 whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are
5813 the fishermen's names for a few sorts.
5814 
5815 In connection with this appellative of "Whalebone whales," it is of
5816 great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
5817 convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it
5818 is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,
5819 founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;
5820 notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously
5821 seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of
5822 Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the
5823 whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,
5824 back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
5825 indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any
5826 regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and
5827 more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked
5828 whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this
5829 same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has
5830 baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the
5831 same with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of
5832 whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any
5833 one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy
5834 all general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock
5835 every one of the whale-naturalists has split.
5836 
5837 But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
5838 whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
5839 right classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
5840 Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have
5841 seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
5842 Greenland whale.  And if you descend into the bowels of the various
5843 leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part
5844 as available to the systematizer as those external ones already
5845 enumerated.  What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the
5846 whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them
5847 that way.  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and
5848 it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is
5849 practicable.  To proceed.
5850 
5851 BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on
5852 the northern American coast.  He has been frequently captured there,
5853 and towed into harbor.  He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or
5854 you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale.  At any rate, the
5855 popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the
5856 sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one.  His oil is not
5857 very valuable.  He has baleen.  He is the most gamesome and
5858 light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water
5859 generally than any other of them.
5860 
5861 BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is
5862 known but his name.  I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.  Of
5863 a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.  Though
5864 no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which
5865 rises in a long sharp ridge.  Let him go.  I know little more of him,
5866 nor does anybody else.
5867 
5868 BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring
5869 gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along
5870 the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings.  He is seldom
5871 seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern
5872 seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his
5873 countenance.  He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks
5874 of line.  Prodigies are told of him.  Adieu, Sulphur Bottom!  I can
5875 say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.
5876 
5877 Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).
5878 
5879 OCTAVOES.*--These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among
5880 which present may be numbered:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH;
5881 III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.
5882 
5883 
5884 *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
5885 Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those
5886 of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to
5887 them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned
5888 form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo
5889 volume does.
5890 
5891 
5892 BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose
5893 loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb
5894 to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
5895 popularly classed among whales.  But possessing all the grand
5896 distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have
5897 recognised him for one.  He is of moderate octavo size, varying from
5898 fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding
5899 dimensions round the waist.  He swims in herds; he is never regularly
5900 hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good
5901 for light.  By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory
5902 of the advance of the great sperm whale.
5903 
5904 BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular
5905 fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the
5906 best.  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall
5907 say so, and suggest another.  I do so now, touching the Black Fish,
5908 so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.
5909 So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.  His voracity is well
5910 known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips
5911 are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on
5912 his face.  This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in
5913 length.  He is found in almost all latitudes.  He has a peculiar way
5914 of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something
5915 like a Roman nose.  When not more profitably employed, the sperm
5916 whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the
5917 supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as some frugal
5918 housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
5919 themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.  Though
5920 their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you
5921 upwards of thirty gallons of oil.
5922 
5923 BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL
5924 WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I
5925 suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked
5926 nose.  The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn
5927 averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to
5928 fifteen feet.  Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk,
5929 growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the
5930 horizontal.  But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an
5931 ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a
5932 clumsy left-handed man.  What precise purpose this ivory horn or
5933 lance answers, it would be hard to say.  It does not seem to be used
5934 like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors
5935 tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the
5936 bottom of the sea for food.  Charley Coffin said it was used for an
5937 ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar
5938 Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so
5939 breaks through.  But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be
5940 correct.  My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may
5941 really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would
5942 certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading
5943 pamphlets.  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the
5944 Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale.  He is certainly a curious
5945 example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of
5946 animated nature.  From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered
5947 that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the
5948 great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it
5949 brought immense prices.  It was also distilled to a volatile salts
5950 for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are
5951 manufactured into hartshorn.  Originally it was in itself accounted
5952 an object of great curiosity.  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin
5953 Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did
5954 gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich
5955 Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; "when Sir Martin
5956 returned from that voyage," saith Black Letter, "on bended knees he
5957 presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,
5958 which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor."  An
5959 Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did
5960 likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land
5961 beast of the unicorn nature.
5962 
5963 The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
5964 milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
5965 His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
5966 and he is seldom hunted.  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
5967 
5968 BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whale little is
5969 precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the
5970 professed naturalist.  From what I have seen of him at a distance,
5971 I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus.  He is very
5972 savage--a sort of Feegee fish.  He sometimes takes the great Folio
5973 whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty
5974 brute is worried to death.  The Killer is never hunted.  I never
5975 heard what sort of oil he has.  Exception might be taken to the name
5976 bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness.  For
5977 we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks
5978 included.
5979 
5980 BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This gentleman is famous
5981 for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.  He
5982 mounts the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage
5983 by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a
5984 similar process.  Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the
5985 Killer.  Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.
5986 
5987 Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).
5988 
5989 DUODECIMOES.--These include the smaller whales.  I. The Huzza
5990 Porpoise.  II. The Algerine Porpoise.  III. The Mealy-mouthed
5991 Porpoise.
5992 
5993 To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
5994 possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or
5995 five feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the
5996 popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.  But the creatures
5997 set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of
5998 my definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a
5999 horizontal tail.
6000 
6001 BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the
6002 common porpoise found almost all over the globe.  The name is of my
6003 own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and
6004 something must be done to distinguish them.  I call him thus, because
6005 he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep
6006 tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.
6007 Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner.
6008 Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to
6009 windward.  They are the lads that always live before the wind.  They
6010 are accounted a lucky omen.  If you yourself can withstand three
6011 cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the
6012 spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.  A well-fed, plump Huzza
6013 Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil.  But the fine
6014 and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.
6015 It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers.  Sailors put it on
6016 their hones.  Porpoise meat is good eating, you know.  It may never
6017 have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.  Indeed, his spout is so
6018 small that it is not very readily discernible.  But the next time you
6019 have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale
6020 himself in miniature.
6021 
6022 BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate.
6023 Very savage.  He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.  He is
6024 somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general
6025 make.  Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.  I have lowered
6026 for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.
6027 
6028 BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The
6029 largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it
6030 is known.  The only English name, by which he has hitherto been
6031 designated, is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the
6032 circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio.
6033 In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of
6034 a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
6035 gentleman-like figure.  He has no fins on his back (most other
6036 porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of
6037 a hazel hue.  But his mealy-mouth spoils all.  Though his entire
6038 back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line,
6039 distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the "bright waist,"
6040 that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours,
6041 black above and white below.  The white comprises part of his head,
6042 and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just
6043 escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.  A most mean and mealy
6044 aspect!  His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.
6045 
6046 
6047 Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
6048 Porpoise is the smallest of the whales.  Above, you have all the
6049 Leviathans of note.  But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
6050 half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
6051 reputation, but not personally.  I shall enumerate them by their
6052 fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
6053 future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.
6054 If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked,
6055 then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to
6056 his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale;
6057 the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading
6058 Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the
6059 Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc.
6060 From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might
6061 be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of
6062 uncouth names.  But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can
6063 hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism,
6064 but signifying nothing.
6065 
6066 Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
6067 here, and at once, perfected.  You cannot but plainly see that I have
6068 kept my word.  But I now leave my cetological System standing thus
6069 unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
6070 crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.  For
6071 small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand
6072 ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.  God keep me
6073 from ever completing anything.  This whole book is but a
6074 draught--nay, but the draught of a draught.  Oh, Time, Strength,
6075 Cash, and Patience!
6076 
6077 
6078 
6079 CHAPTER 33
6080 
6081 The Specksynder.
6082 
6083 
6084 Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a
6085 place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,
6086 arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a
6087 class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
6088 
6089 The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced
6090 by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
6091 and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
6092 the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
6093 officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means
6094 Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief
6095 Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to
6096 the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the
6097 whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or
6098 Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,
6099 under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is
6100 still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present
6101 he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the
6102 captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good
6103 conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
6104 depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an
6105 important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night
6106 watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also
6107 his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he
6108 should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in
6109 some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,
6110 by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.
6111 
6112 Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
6113 this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships
6114 and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the
6115 captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers
6116 are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take
6117 their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly
6118 communicating with it.
6119 
6120 Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the
6121 longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils
6122 of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all
6123 of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages,
6124 but upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance,
6125 intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases
6126 tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen
6127 generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family
6128 these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for
6129 all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck
6130 are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.  Indeed,
6131 many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
6132 parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in
6133 any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if
6134 he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
6135 
6136 And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
6137 given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only
6138 homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though
6139 he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping
6140 upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to
6141 peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be
6142 detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of
6143 condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was
6144 by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.
6145 
6146 Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
6147 those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
6148 incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than
6149 they were legitimately intended to subserve.  That certain sultanism
6150 of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained
6151 unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became
6152 incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.  For be a man's
6153 intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the
6154 practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of
6155 some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves,
6156 more or less paltry and base.  This it is, that for ever keeps God's
6157 true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and leaves the
6158 highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous
6159 more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful
6160 of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over
6161 the dead level of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small
6162 things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some
6163 royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.
6164 But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of
6165 geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian
6166 herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.  Nor, will
6167 the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its
6168 fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so
6169 important in his art, as the one now alluded to.
6170 
6171 But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
6172 grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
6173 Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
6174 whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical
6175 trappings and housings are denied me.  Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand
6176 in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in
6177 the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!
6178 
6179 
6180 
6181 CHAPTER 34
6182 
6183 The Cabin-Table.
6184 
6185 
6186 It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
6187 loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his
6188 lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been
6189 taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the
6190 latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that
6191 daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.  From his complete
6192 inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not
6193 heard his menial.  But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,
6194 he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,
6195 saying, "Dinner, Mr. Starbuck," disappears into the cabin.
6196 
6197 When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,
6198 the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then
6199 Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the
6200 planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some
6201 touch of pleasantness, "Dinner, Mr. Stubb," and descends the scuttle.
6202 The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly
6203 shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with
6204 that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a
6205 rapid "Dinner, Mr. Flask," follows after his predecessors.
6206 
6207 But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
6208 seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
6209 sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off
6210 his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe
6211 right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,
6212 pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down
6213 rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,
6214 reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.
6215 But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new
6216 face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask
6217 enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the
6218 Slave.
6219 
6220 It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
6221 artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
6222 some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
6223 defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
6224 very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in
6225 that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not
6226 to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head
6227 of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore
6228 this difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,
6229 King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but
6230 courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane
6231 grandeur.  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit
6232 presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that
6233 man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the
6234 time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for
6235 Belshazzar was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends,
6236 has tasted what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social
6237 czarship which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this
6238 consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,
6239 then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of
6240 sea-life just mentioned.
6241 
6242 Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned
6243 sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but
6244 still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited
6245 to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in
6246 Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With
6247 one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as
6248 he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the
6249 world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest
6250 observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And
6251 when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef
6252 was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the
6253 mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;
6254 and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the
6255 plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without
6256 circumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where
6257 the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial
6258 Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in
6259 awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;
6260 only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,
6261 when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little
6262 Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family
6263 party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have
6264 been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,
6265 this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first
6266 degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more
6267 would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
6268 nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask
6269 helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed
6270 it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.
6271 Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on
6272 account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he
6273 deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter
6274 was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however
6275 it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!
6276 
6277 Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and
6278 Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was
6279 badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start
6280 of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.
6281 If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have
6282 but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his
6283 repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than
6284 three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to
6285 precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted
6286 in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an
6287 officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
6288 otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much
6289 relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and
6290 satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.
6291 I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned
6292 beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.
6293 There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:
6294 there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere
6295 sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official
6296 capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
6297 vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask
6298 through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
6299 awful Ahab.
6300 
6301 Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first
6302 table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in
6303 inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or
6304 rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And
6305 then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its
6306 residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of
6307 the high and mighty cabin.
6308 
6309 In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
6310 invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire
6311 care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those
6312 inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,
6313 seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the
6314 harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a
6315 report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like
6316 Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites
6317 had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the
6318 previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a
6319 great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.
6320 And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble
6321 hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
6322 accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And
6323 once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory
6324 by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
6325 wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the
6326 circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,
6327 shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the
6328 progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the
6329 standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical
6330 tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life
6331 was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers
6332 furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their
6333 clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at
6334 them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.
6335 
6336 It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing
6337 his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on
6338 the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to
6339 the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the
6340 low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes
6341 passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was
6342 wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible
6343 that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the
6344 vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.
6345 But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the
6346 abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in
6347 the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants
6348 made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of
6349 the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the
6350 trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth
6351 lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing
6352 out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the
6353 simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round
6354 him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the
6355 whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their
6356 lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they
6357 would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not
6358 at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that
6359 in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
6360 guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!
6361 hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin
6362 should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to
6363 his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;
6364 to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones
6365 jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.
6366 
6367 But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
6368 there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
6369 scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before
6370 sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar
6371 quarters.
6372 
6373 In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
6374 captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
6375 the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone
6376 that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real
6377 truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be
6378 said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did
6379 enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning
6380 inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a
6381 permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much
6382 hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was
6383 inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of
6384 Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as
6385 the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when
6386 Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying
6387 himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking
6388 his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul,
6389 shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen
6390 paws of its gloom!
6391 
6392 
6393 
6394 CHAPTER 35
6395 
6396 The Mast-Head.
6397 
6398 
6399 It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with
6400 the other seamen my first mast-head came round.
6401 
6402 In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
6403 simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she
6404 may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her
6405 proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'
6406 voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an
6407 empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;
6408 and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,
6409 does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.
6410 
6411 Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
6412 very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
6413 here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the
6414 old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to
6415 them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must
6416 doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest
6417 mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was
6418 put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have
6419 gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we
6420 cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And
6421 that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an
6422 assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that
6423 the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory
6424 singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four
6425 sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of
6426 their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and
6427 sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing
6428 out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,
6429 the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone
6430 pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life
6431 on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in
6432 him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
6433 stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by
6434 fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything
6435 out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern
6436 standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
6437 and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,
6438 are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon
6439 discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top
6440 of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred
6441 and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
6442 whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great
6443 Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in
6444 Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that
6445 point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral
6446 Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in
6447 Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,
6448 token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
6449 smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
6450 Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked
6451 to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they
6452 gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate
6453 through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what
6454 rocks must be shunned.
6455 
6456 It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
6457 standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is
6458 not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
6459 historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells
6460 us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were
6461 regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island
6462 erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs
6463 ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in
6464 a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay
6465 whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to
6466 the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now
6467 become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a
6468 whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from
6469 sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the
6470 helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene
6471 weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,
6472 to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a
6473 hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if
6474 the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your
6475 legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships
6476 once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.
6477 There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing
6478 ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy
6479 trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most
6480 part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests
6481 you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling
6482 accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary
6483 excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
6484 securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of
6485 what you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years
6486 and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is
6487 immutable.
6488 
6489 In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'
6490 voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at
6491 the mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much
6492 to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a
6493 portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly
6494 destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or
6495 adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains
6496 to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or
6497 any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men
6498 temporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is
6499 the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin
6500 parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant
6501 cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about
6502 as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold
6503 weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a
6504 watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more
6505 of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of
6506 its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even
6507 move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an
6508 ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat
6509 is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional
6510 skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in
6511 your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your
6512 watch-coat.
6513 
6514 Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of
6515 a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
6516 or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a
6517 Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the
6518 frozen seas.  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled
6519 "A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and
6520 incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of
6521 Old Greenland;" in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads
6522 are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then
6523 recently invented CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of
6524 Captain Sleet's good craft.  He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in
6525 honour of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and
6526 free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call
6527 our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original
6528 inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after
6529 ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.  In shape, the Sleet's
6530 crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open
6531 above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to
6532 keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.  Being fixed on the
6533 summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in
6534 the bottom.  On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship,
6535 is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,
6536 comforters, and coats.  In front is a leather rack, in which to keep
6537 your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical
6538 conveniences.  When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in
6539 this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with
6540 him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,
6541 for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea
6542 unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at
6543 them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot
6544 down upon them is a very different thing.  Now, it was plainly a
6545 labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
6546 little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so
6547 enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very
6548 scientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a
6549 small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the
6550 errors resulting from what is called the "local attraction" of all
6551 binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of
6552 the iron in the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to
6553 there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I
6554 say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here,
6555 yet, for all his learned "binnacle deviations," "azimuth compass
6556 observations," and "approximate errors," he knows very well, Captain
6557 Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
6558 meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that
6559 well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side
6560 of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.  Though, upon the
6561 whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and
6562 learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so
6563 utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and
6564 comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded
6565 head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest
6566 within three or four perches of the pole.
6567 
6568 But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
6569 Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
6570 greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
6571 seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float.  For one, I
6572 used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to
6573 have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find
6574 there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg
6575 over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery
6576 pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.
6577 
6578 Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept
6579 but sorry guard.  With the problem of the universe revolving in me,
6580 how could I--being left completely to myself at such a
6581 thought-engendering altitude--how could I but lightly hold my
6582 obligations to observe all whale-ships' standing orders, "Keep your
6583 weather eye open, and sing out every time."
6584 
6585 And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
6586 Nantucket!  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad
6587 with lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;
6588 and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his
6589 head.  Beware of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before
6590 they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you
6591 ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the
6592 richer.  Nor are these monitions at all unneeded.  For nowadays, the
6593 whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and
6594 absent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth,
6595 and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber.  Childe Harold not
6596 unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless
6597 disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:--
6598 
6599 "Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!  Ten thousand
6600 blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."
6601 
6602 Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
6603 young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling
6604 sufficient "interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so
6605 hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret
6606 souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.  But all in
6607 vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is
6608 imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the
6609 visual nerve?  They have left their opera-glasses at home.
6610 
6611 "Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've
6612 been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a
6613 whale yet.  Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up
6614 here."  Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of
6615 them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like
6616 listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded
6617 youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he
6618 loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the
6619 visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind
6620 and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing
6621 that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some
6622 undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive
6623 thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through
6624 it.  In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came;
6625 becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's sprinkled
6626 Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round
6627 globe over.
6628 
6629 There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
6630 gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
6631 the inscrutable tides of God.  But while this sleep, this dream is on
6632 ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
6633 identity comes back in horror.  Over Descartian vortices you hover.
6634 And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one
6635 half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the
6636 summer sea, no more to rise for ever.  Heed it well, ye Pantheists!
6637 
6638 
6639 
6640 CHAPTER 36
6641 
6642 The Quarter-Deck.
6643 
6644 
6645 (ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)
6646 
6647 
6648 It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one
6649 morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
6650 cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at
6651 that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few
6652 turns in the garden.
6653 
6654 Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his
6655 old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all
6656 over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his
6657 walk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;
6658 there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints
6659 of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
6660 
6661 But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as
6662 his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of
6663 his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at
6664 the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that
6665 thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so
6666 completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward
6667 mould of every outer movement.
6668 
6669 "D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him
6670 pecks the shell.  'Twill soon be out."
6671 
6672 The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
6673 the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
6674 
6675 It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the
6676 bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and
6677 with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send
6678 everybody aft.
6679 
6680 "Sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
6681 ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
6682 
6683 "Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab.  "Mast-heads, there! come down!"
6684 
6685 When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and
6686 not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not
6687 unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after
6688 rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among
6689 the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were
6690 nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and
6691 half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering
6692 whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,
6693 that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing
6694 a pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,
6695 he cried:--
6696 
6697 "What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"
6698 
6699 "Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of
6700 clubbed voices.
6701 
6702 "Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
6703 hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so
6704 magnetically thrown them.
6705 
6706 "And what do ye next, men?"
6707 
6708 "Lower away, and after him!"
6709 
6710 "And what tune is it ye pull to, men?"
6711 
6712 "A dead whale or a stove boat!"
6713 
6714 More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
6715 countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began
6716 to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that
6717 they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless
6718 questions.
6719 
6720 But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in
6721 his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
6722 almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--
6723 
6724 "All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a
6725 white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?"--holding
6726 up a broad bright coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen dollar piece,
6727 men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul."
6728 
6729 While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
6730 slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
6731 to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile
6732 lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
6733 inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of
6734 his vitality in him.
6735 
6736 Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the
6737 main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold
6738 with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever
6739 of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a
6740 crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with
6741 three holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of
6742 ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my
6743 boys!"
6744 
6745 "Huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
6746 hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
6747 
6748 "It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw down the
6749 topmaul: "a white whale.  Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
6750 white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out."
6751 
6752 All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
6753 more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
6754 of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
6755 separately touched by some specific recollection.
6756 
6757 "Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whale must be the same
6758 that some call Moby Dick."
6759 
6760 "Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab.  "Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?"
6761 
6762 "Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?" said
6763 the Gay-Header deliberately.
6764 
6765 "And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "very bushy, even for
6766 a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"
6767 
6768 "And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
6769 Captain," cried Queequeg disjointedly, "all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
6770 him--him--" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round
6771 and round as though uncorking a bottle--"like him--him--"
6772 
6773 "Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
6774 and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a
6775 whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after
6776 the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like
6777 a split jib in a squall.  Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye
6778 have seen--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!"
6779 
6780 "Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus
6781 far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last
6782 seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.
6783 "Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick
6784 that took off thy leg?"
6785 
6786 "Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck; aye,
6787 my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick
6788 that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye," he
6789 shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a
6790 heart-stricken moose; "Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale
6791 that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!"
6792 Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted
6793 out: "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the
6794 Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames
6795 before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to
6796 chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of
6797 earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,
6798 men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave."
6799 
6800 "Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
6801 excited old man: "A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
6802 Moby Dick!"
6803 
6804 "God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout.  "God bless ye,
6805 men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what's this
6806 long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?
6807 art not game for Moby Dick?"
6808 
6809 "I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,
6810 Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we
6811 follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.
6812 How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest
6813 it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket
6814 market."
6815 
6816 "Nantucket market!  Hoot!  But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest
6817 a little lower layer.  If money's to be the measurer, man, and the
6818 accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
6819 girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
6820 let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!"
6821 
6822 "He smites his chest," whispered Stubb, "what's that for? methinks it
6823 rings most vast, but hollow."
6824 
6825 "Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee
6826 from blindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enraged with a dumb thing,
6827 Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."
6828 
6829 "Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer.  All visible objects,
6830 man, are but as pasteboard masks.  But in each event--in the living
6831 act, the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning
6832 thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the
6833 unreasoning mask.  If man will strike, strike through the mask!  How
6834 can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?
6835 To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.  Sometimes I
6836 think there's naught beyond.  But 'tis enough.  He tasks me; he heaps
6837 me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice
6838 sinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be
6839 the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak
6840 that hate upon him.  Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the
6841 sun if it insulted me.  For could the sun do that, then could I do
6842 the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy
6843 presiding over all creations.  But not my master, man, is even that
6844 fair play.  Who's over me?  Truth hath no confines.  Take off thine
6845 eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!  So,
6846 so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow.
6847 But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays
6848 itself.  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity.  I
6849 meant not to incense thee.  Let it go.  Look! see yonder Turkish
6850 cheeks of spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the
6851 sun.  The Pagan leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things,
6852 that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they
6853 feel!  The crew, man, the crew!  Are they not one and all with Ahab,
6854 in this matter of the whale?  See Stubb! he laughs!  See yonder
6855 Chilian! he snorts to think of it.  Stand up amid the general
6856 hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck!  And what is it?
6857 Reckon it.  'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for
6858 Starbuck.  What is it more?  From this one poor hunt, then, the best
6859 lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every
6860 foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone?  Ah! constrainings seize
6861 thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!  Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye! thy
6862 silence, then, THAT voices thee.  (ASIDE) Something shot from my
6863 dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs.  Starbuck now is
6864 mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion."
6865 
6866 "God keep me!--keep us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.
6867 
6868 But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab
6869 did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from
6870 the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the
6871 cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as
6872 for a moment their hearts sank in.  For again Starbuck's downcast
6873 eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh
6874 died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved
6875 and rolled as before.  Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye
6876 not when ye come?  But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye
6877 shadows!  Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications
6878 of the foregoing things within.  For with little external to
6879 constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still
6880 drive us on.
6881 
6882 "The measure! the measure!" cried Ahab.
6883 
6884 Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
6885 ordered them to produce their weapons.  Then ranging them before him
6886 near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three
6887 mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's
6888 company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
6889 searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.  But those wild eyes met
6890 his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of
6891 their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the
6892 bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.
6893 
6894 "Drink and pass!" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
6895 nearest seaman.  "The crew alone now drink.  Round with it, round!
6896 Short draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof.  So,
6897 so; it goes round excellently.  It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
6898 serpent-snapping eye.  Well done; almost drained.  That way it went,
6899 this way it comes.  Hand it me--here's a hollow!  Men, ye seem the
6900 years; so brimming life is gulped and gone.  Steward, refill!
6901 
6902 "Attend now, my braves.  I have mustered ye all round this capstan;
6903 and ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand
6904 there with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may
6905 in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before
6906 me.  O men, you will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies
6907 come not sooner.  Hand it me.  Why, now, this pewter had run brimming
6908 again, were't not thou St. Vitus' imp--away, thou ague!
6909 
6910 "Advance, ye mates!  Cross your lances full before me.  Well done!
6911 Let me touch the axis."  So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the
6912 three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so
6913 doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing
6914 intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.  It seemed as
6915 though, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have
6916 shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the
6917 Leyden jar of his own magnetic life.  The three mates quailed before
6918 his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.  Stubb and Flask looked
6919 sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.
6920 
6921 "In vain!" cried Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well.  For did ye three but
6922 once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, THAT
6923 had perhaps expired from out me.  Perchance, too, it would have
6924 dropped ye dead.  Perchance ye need it not.  Down lances!  And now,
6925 ye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen
6926 there--yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant
6927 harpooneers.  Disdain the task?  What, when the great Pope washes the
6928 feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?  Oh, my sweet cardinals!
6929 your own condescension, THAT shall bend ye to it.  I do not order ye;
6930 ye will it.  Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"
6931 
6932 Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
6933 detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held,
6934 barbs up, before him.
6935 
6936 "Stab me not with that keen steel!  Cant them; cant them over! know
6937 ye not the goblet end?  Turn up the socket!  So, so; now, ye
6938 cup-bearers, advance.  The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!"
6939 Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed
6940 the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.
6941 
6942 "Now, three to three, ye stand.  Commend the murderous chalices!
6943 Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league.
6944 Ha!  Starbuck! but the deed is done!  Yon ratifying sun now waits to
6945 sit upon it.  Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man
6946 the deathful whaleboat's bow--Death to Moby Dick!  God hunt us all,
6947 if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!"  The long, barbed steel
6948 goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white
6949 whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.
6950 Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.  Once more, and finally,
6951 the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,
6952 waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired
6953 within his cabin.

6961 
6962 THE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.
6963 
6964 
6965 I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er
6966 I sail.  The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let
6967 them; but first I pass.
6968 
6969 Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like
6970 wine.  The gold brow plumbs the blue.  The diver sun--slow dived from
6971 noon--goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless
6972 hill.  Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of
6973 Lombardy.  Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not
6974 its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly
6975 confounds.  'Tis iron--that I know--not gold.  'Tis split, too--that
6976 I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against
6977 the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no
6978 helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
6979 
6980 Dry heat upon my brow?  Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly
6981 spurred me, so the sunset soothed.  No more.  This lovely light, it
6982 lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er
6983 enjoy.  Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying
6984 power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst
6985 of Paradise!  Good night--good night! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM
6986 THE WINDOW.)
6987 
6988 'Twas not so hard a task.  I thought to find one stubborn, at the
6989 least; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels,
6990 and they revolve.  Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder,
6991 they all stand before me; and I their match.  Oh, hard! that to fire
6992 others, the match itself must needs be wasting!  What I've dared,
6993 I've willed; and what I've willed, I'll do!  They think me
6994 mad--Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened!  That
6995 wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself!  The prophecy was
6996 that I should be dismembered; and--Aye!  I lost this leg.  I now
6997 prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.  Now, then, be the
6998 prophet and the fulfiller one.  That's more than ye, ye great gods,
6999 ever were.  I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,
7000 ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!  I will not say as schoolboys
7001 do to bullies--Take some one of your own size; don't pommel ME!  No,
7002 ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but YE have run and hidden.
7003 Come forth from behind your cotton bags!  I have no long gun to
7004 reach ye.  Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see if ye can
7005 swerve me.  Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve
7006 yourselves! man has ye there.  Swerve me?  The path to my fixed
7007 purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
7008 Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
7009 torrents' beds, unerringly I rush!  Naught's an obstacle, naught's an
7010 angle to the iron way!

7020 
7021 
7022 My soul is more than matched; she's overmanned; and by a madman!
7023 Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field!
7024 But he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me!  I
7025 think I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it.
7026 Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with
7027 a cable I have no knife to cut.  Horrible old man!  Who's over him,
7028 he cries;--aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he
7029 lords it over all below!  Oh!  I plainly see my miserable office,--to
7030 obey, rebelling; and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!  For in
7031 his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it.  Yet is
7032 there hope.  Time and tide flow wide.  The hated whale has the round
7033 watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe.
7034 His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside.  I would up
7035 heart, were it not like lead.  But my whole clock's run down; my
7036 heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.

7040 
7041 
7042 Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of
7043 human mothers in them!  Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea.  The
7044 white whale is their demigorgon.  Hark! the infernal orgies! that
7045 revelry is forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft!  Methinks it
7046 pictures life.  Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay,
7047 embattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where
7048 he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of
7049 the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.  The long
7050 howl thrills me through!  Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch!
7051 Oh, life!  'tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to
7052 knowledge,--as wild, untutored things are forced to feed--Oh, life!
7053 'tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but 'tis not me!
7054 that horror's out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in
7055 me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures!  Stand by
7056 me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!

7068 
7069 Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!--I've been thinking over it
7070 ever since, and that ha, ha's the final consequence.  Why so?
7071 Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer; and
7072 come what will, one comfort's always left--that unfailing comfort is,
7073 it's all predestinated.  I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but
7074 to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening
7075 felt.  Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too.  I twigged it, knew
7076 it; had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when I
7077 clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.  Well, Stubb, WISE
7078 Stubb--that's my title--well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?  Here's a
7079 carcase.  I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will,
7080 I'll go to it laughing.  Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your
7081 horribles!  I feel funny.  Fa, la! lirra, skirra!  What's my juicy
7082 little pear at home doing now?  Crying its eyes out?--Giving a party
7083 to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate's
7084 pennant, and so am I--fa, la! lirra, skirra!  Oh--
7085 
7086 We'll drink to-night with hearts as light,
7087 To love, as gay and fleeting
7088 As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim,
7089 And break on the lips while meeting.
7090 
7091 
7092 A brave stave that--who calls?  Mr. Starbuck?  Aye, aye, sir--(ASIDE)
7093 he's my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.--Aye, aye,

7118 A viewing of those gallant whales
7119 That blew at every strand.
7120 Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
7121 And by your braces stand,
7122 And we'll have one of those fine whales,

7132 the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch.
7133 I've the sort of mouth for that--the hogshead mouth.  So, so,

7135 Eight bells there below!  Tumble up!
7136 
7137 DUTCH SAILOR.
7138 Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that.  I mark this in
7139 our old Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping to
7140 others.  We sing; they sleep--aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
7141 butts.  At 'em again!  There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em
7142 through it.  Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses.  Tell 'em
7143 it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to
7144 judgment.  That's the way--THAT'S it; thy throat ain't spoiled with
7145 eating Amsterdam butter.

7147 FRENCH SAILOR.
7148 Hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in

7159 and gallop into the double-shuffle?  Throw yourselves!  Legs! legs!
7160 
7161 ICELAND SAILOR.
7162 I don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my taste.  I'm

7164 but excuse me.

7208 I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are
7209 dancing over.  I'll dance over your grave, I will--that's the
7210 bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
7211 corners.  O Christ! to think of the green navies and the
7212 green-skulled crews!  Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as
7213 you scholars have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it.
7214 Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.

7229 It's the waves--the snow's caps turn to jig it now.  They'll shake
7230 their tassels soon.  Now would all the waves were women, then I'd go
7231 drown, and chassee with them evermore!  There's naught so sweet on
7232 earth--heaven may not match it!--as those swift glances of warm, wild
7233 bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe,
7234 bursting grapes.

7238 Tell me not of it!  Hark ye, lad--fleet interlacings of the

7246 veiled, high palmed Tahiti!  I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft
7247 soil has slid!  I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first
7248 day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite.  Ah me!--not thou
7249 nor I can bear the change!  How then, if so be transplanted to yon
7250 sky?  Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee's peak of spears,
7251 when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?--The blast! the
7252 blast!  Up, spine, and meet it! (LEAPS TO HIS FEET.)

7266 He has his orders, mind ye that.  I heard old Ahab tell him he must
7267 always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a
7268 pistol--fire your ship right into it!
7269 
7270 ENGLISH SAILOR.
7271 Blood! but that old man's a grand old cove!  We are the lads to hunt
7272 him up his whale!
7273 
7274 ALL.
7275 Aye! aye!
7276 
7277 OLD MANX SAILOR.
7278 How the three pines shake!  Pines are the hardest sort of tree to
7279 live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none but the
7280 crew's cursed clay.  Steady, helmsman! steady.  This is the sort of
7281 weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea.
7282 Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there's another in
7283 the sky--lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.
7284 
7285 DAGGOO.
7286 What of that?  Who's afraid of black's afraid of me!  I'm quarried
7287 out of it!
7288 
7289 SPANISH SAILOR.
7290 (ASIDE.) He wants to bully, ah!--the old grudge makes me touchy
7291 (ADVANCING.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of
7292 mankind--devilish dark at that.  No offence.
7293 
7294 DAGGOO (GRIMLY).
7295 None.
7296 
7297 ST. JAGO'S SAILOR.
7298 That Spaniard's mad or drunk.  But that can't be, or else in his one
7299 case our old Mogul's fire-waters are somewhat long in working.

7301 5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.
7302 What's that I saw--lightning?  Yes.

7304 SPANISH SAILOR.
7305 No; Daggoo showing his teeth.

7309 
7310 SPANISH SAILOR (MEETING HIM).
7311 Knife thee heartily! big frame, small spirit!
7312 
7313 ALL.
7314 A row! a row! a row!
7315 
7316 TASHTEGO (WITH A WHIFF).
7317 A row a'low, and a row aloft--Gods and men--both brawlers!  Humph!
7318 
7319 BELFAST SAILOR.
7320 A row! arrah a row!  The Virgin be blessed, a row!  Plunge in with
7321 ye!
7322 
7323 ENGLISH SAILOR.
7324 Fair play!  Snatch the Spaniard's knife!  A ring, a ring!
7325 
7326 OLD MANX SAILOR.
7327 Ready formed.  There! the ringed horizon.  In that ring Cain struck
7328 Abel.  Sweet work, right work!  No?  Why then, God, mad'st thou the
7329 ring?
7330 
7331 MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.
7332 Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails!  Stand by to reef
7333 topsails!
7334 
7335 ALL.
7336 The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (THEY SCATTER.)
7337 
7338 
7339 PIP (SHRINKING UNDER THE WINDLASS).
7340 Jollies?  Lord help such jollies!  Crish, crash! there goes the
7341 jib-stay!  Blang-whang!  God!  Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal
7342 yard!  It's worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of
7343 the year!  Who'd go climbing after chestnuts now?  But there they
7344 go, all cursing, and here I don't.  Fine prospects to 'em; they're on
7345 the road to heaven.  Hold on hard!  Jimmini, what a squall!  But
7346 those chaps there are worse yet--they are your white squalls, they.
7347 White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr!  Here have I heard all
7348 their chat just now, and the white whale--shirr! shirr!--but spoken
7349 of once! and only this evening--it makes me jingle all over like my
7350 tambourine--that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him!
7351 Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have
7352 mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men
7353 that have no bowels to feel fear!

7357 CHAPTER 41
7358 
7359 Moby Dick.
7360 
7361 
7362 I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the
7363 rest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted,
7364 and more did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my
7365 soul.  A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's
7366 quenchless feud seemed mine.  With greedy ears I learned the history
7367 of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken
7368 our oaths of violence and revenge.
7369 
7370 For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
7371 secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
7372 frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen.  But not all of them knew of
7373 his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen
7374 him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
7375 battle to him, was small indeed.  For, owing to the large number of
7376 whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the
7377 entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their
7378 quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole
7379 twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling
7380 sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the
7381 irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other
7382 circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread
7383 through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
7384 individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick.  It was hardly to be
7385 doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such
7386 or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of
7387 uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great
7388 mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some
7389 minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in
7390 question must have been no other than Moby Dick.  Yet as of late the
7391 Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
7392 instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
7393 attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly
7394 gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,
7395 were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it
7396 were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the
7397 individual cause.  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter
7398 between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.
7399 
7400 And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by
7401 chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had
7402 every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,
7403 as for any other whale of that species.  But at length, such
7404 calamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained
7405 wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal
7406 to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,
7407 all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those
7408 things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to
7409 whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.
7410 
7411 Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the
7412 more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.  For not
7413 only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all
7414 surprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its
7415 fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,
7416 wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them
7417 to cling to.  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so
7418 the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the
7419 wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate
7420 there.  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that
7421 ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all
7422 sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact
7423 with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face
7424 they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle
7425 to them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a
7426 thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to
7427 any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of
7428 the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a
7429 calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending
7430 to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.
7431 
7432 No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit
7433 over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale
7434 did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid
7435 hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,
7436 which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from
7437 anything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic
7438 did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had
7439 heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to
7440 encounter the perils of his jaw.
7441 
7442 But there were still other and more vital practical influences at
7443 work.  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the
7444 Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
7445 leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.  There
7446 are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
7447 enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
7448 perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
7449 timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there
7450 are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not
7451 sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered
7452 the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is
7453 restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;
7454 seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
7455 fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern
7456 whaling.  Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm
7457 Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those
7458 prows which stem him.
7459 
7460 And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
7461 times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
7462 naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only
7463 to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to
7464 be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human
7465 blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or
7466 almost similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History, the
7467 Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish
7468 (sharks included) are "struck with the most lively terrors," and
7469 "often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against
7470 the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death."  And
7471 however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports
7472 as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty
7473 item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some
7474 vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
7475 
7476 So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
7477 of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier
7478 days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to
7479 induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this
7480 new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other
7481 leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance
7482 at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.
7483 That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick
7484 eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may
7485 be consulted.
7486 
7487 Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
7488 were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number
7489 who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
7490 specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
7491 accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle
7492 if offered.
7493 
7494 One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be
7495 linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously
7496 inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;
7497 that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one
7498 and the same instant of time.
7499 
7500 Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
7501 altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.  For
7502 as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been
7503 divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of
7504 the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,
7505 unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated
7506 the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,
7507 especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a
7508 great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the
7509 most widely distant points.
7510 
7511 It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,
7512 and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by
7513 Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the
7514 Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted
7515 in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of
7516 these instances it has been declared that the interval of time
7517 between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.
7518 Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the
7519 Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to
7520 the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living
7521 men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
7522 mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in
7523 which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still
7524 more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose
7525 waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an
7526 underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully
7527 equalled by the realities of the whalemen.
7528 
7529 Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and
7530 knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had
7531 escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some
7532 whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring
7533 Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but
7534 ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in
7535 his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should
7536 ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a
7537 ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of
7538 leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.
7539 
7540 But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough
7541 in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to
7542 strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much
7543 his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm
7544 whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white
7545 wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were
7546 his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,
7547 uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to
7548 those who knew him.
7549 
7550 The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with
7551 the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his
7552 distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally
7553 justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through
7554 a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all
7555 spangled with golden gleamings.
7556 
7557 Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet
7558 his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural
7559 terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
7560 specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his
7561 assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of
7562 dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his
7563 exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had
7564 several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down
7565 upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back
7566 in consternation to their ship.
7567 
7568 Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though
7569 similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means
7570 unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White
7571 Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or
7572 death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been
7573 inflicted by an unintelligent agent.
7574 
7575 Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds
7576 of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of
7577 chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out
7578 of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,
7579 exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
7580 
7581 His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in
7582 the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,
7583 had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
7584 seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the
7585 whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly
7586 sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had
7587 reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No
7588 turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with
7589 more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that
7590 ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild
7591 vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his
7592 frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all
7593 his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual
7594 exasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac
7595 incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel
7596 eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
7597 half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the
7598 beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe
7599 one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east
7600 reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship
7601 it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred
7602 white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that
7603 most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all
7604 truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the
7605 brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to
7606 crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable
7607 in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all
7608 the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and
7609 then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's
7610 shell upon it.
7611 
7612 It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise
7613 at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.  Then, in darting at
7614 the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,
7615 passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that
7616 tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but
7617 nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards
7618 home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay
7619 stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that
7620 dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and
7621 gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.
7622 That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,
7623 that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the
7624 fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
7625 and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in
7626 his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,
7627 that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he
7628 sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the
7629 mad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable
7630 latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the
7631 tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium
7632 seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth
7633 from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he
7634 bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm
7635 orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was
7636 now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human
7637 madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you
7638 think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still
7639 subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
7640 contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows
7641 narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in
7642 his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had
7643 been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great
7644 natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became
7645 the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his
7646 special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned
7647 all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from
7648 having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a
7649 thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear
7650 upon any one reasonable object.
7651 
7652 This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains
7653 unhinted.  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is
7654 profound.  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked
7655 Hotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now
7656 quit it;--and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast
7657 Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of
7658 man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits
7659 in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned
7660 on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that
7661 captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his
7662 frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye
7663 prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family
7664 likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from
7665 your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
7666 
7667 Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my
7668 means are sane, my motive and my object mad.  Yet without power to
7669 kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind
7670 he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of
7671 his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his
7672 will determinate.  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that
7673 dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no
7674 Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and
7675 that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken
7676 him.
7677 
7678 The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
7679 ascribed to a kindred cause.  And so too, all the added moodiness
7680 which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on
7681 the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.  Nor is it so very
7682 unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling
7683 voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of
7684 that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those
7685 very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a
7686 pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.
7687 Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting
7688 fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would
7689 seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the
7690 most appalling of all brutes.  Or, if for any reason thought to be
7691 corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem
7692 superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
7693 attack.  But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad
7694 secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had
7695 purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and
7696 all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.  Had any one of his
7697 old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in
7698 him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
7699 wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man!  They were bent on
7700 profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the
7701 mint.  He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
7702 revenge.
7703 
7704 Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with
7705 curses a Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too,
7706 chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and
7707 cannibals--morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere
7708 unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invunerable
7709 jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading
7710 mediocrity in Flask.  Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially
7711 picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his
7712 monomaniac revenge.  How it was that they so aboundingly responded to
7713 the old man's ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
7714 that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much
7715 their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the
7716 White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,
7717 also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding
7718 great demon of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to
7719 dive deeper than Ishmael can go.  The subterranean miner that works
7720 in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever
7721 shifting, muffled sound of his pick?  Who does not feel the
7722 irresistible arm drag?  What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
7723 still?  For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and
7724 the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
7725 naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.
7726 
7727 
7728 
7729 CHAPTER 42
7730 
7731 The Whiteness of The Whale.
7732 
7733 
7734 What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
7735 was to me, as yet remains unsaid.
7736 
7737 Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick,
7738 which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm,
7739 there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror
7740 concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely
7741 overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable
7742 was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.
7743 It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.
7744 But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,
7745 random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be
7746 naught.
7747 
7748 Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,
7749 as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,
7750 japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way
7751 recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the
7752 barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title "Lord of the
7753 White Elephants" above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of
7754 dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white
7755 quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the
7756 one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire,
7757 Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour
7758 the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to
7759 the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over
7760 every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
7761 even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
7762 marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
7763 symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching,
7764 noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though
7765 among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum
7766 was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes, whiteness
7767 typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and
7768 contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
7769 milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
7770 august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine
7771 spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white
7772 forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek
7773 mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white
7774 bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of
7775 the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their
7776 theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest
7777 envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of
7778 their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for
7779 white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their
7780 sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and
7781 though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially
7782 employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the
7783 Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the
7784 four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white
7785 throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for
7786 all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
7787 honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
7788 innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul
7789 than that redness which affrights in blood.
7790 
7791 This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,
7792 when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any
7793 object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest
7794 bounds.  Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of
7795 the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
7796 transcendent horrors they are?  That ghastly whiteness it is which
7797 imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than
7798 terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect.  So that not the
7799 fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as
7800 the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
7801 
7802 
7803 *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him
7804 who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
7805 whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
7806 hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened
7807 hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that
7808 the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in
7809 the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing
7810 together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear
7811 frightens us with so unnatural a contrast.  But even assuming all
7812 this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not
7813 have that intensified terror.
7814 
7815 As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in
7816 that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies
7817 with the same quality in the Polar quadruped.  This peculiarity is
7818 most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that
7819 fish.  The Romish mass for the dead begins with "Requiem eternam"
7820 (eternal rest), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself, and any
7821 other funeral music.  Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness
7822 of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the
7823 French call him REQUIN.
7824 
7825 
7826 Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
7827 wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
7828 imaginations?  Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great,
7829 unflattering laureate, Nature.*
7830 
7831 
7832 *I remember the first albatross I ever saw.  It was during a
7833 prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas.  From my
7834 forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there,
7835 dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of
7836 unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime.  At
7837 intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace
7838 some holy ark.  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it.  Though
7839 bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in
7840 supernatural distress.  Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,
7841 methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.  As Abraham
7842 before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its
7843 wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the
7844 miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.  Long I gazed
7845 at that prodigy of plumage.  I cannot tell, can only hint, the things
7846 that darted through me then.  But at last I awoke; and turning, asked
7847 a sailor what bird was this.  A goney, he replied.  Goney! never had
7848 heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is
7849 utterly unknown to men ashore! never!  But some time after, I learned
7850 that goney was some seaman's name for albatross.  So that by no
7851 possibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with
7852 those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon
7853 our deck.  For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird
7854 to be an albatross.  Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish
7855 a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
7856 
7857 I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
7858 chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in
7859 this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
7860 albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such
7861 emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.
7862 
7863 But how had the mystic thing been caught?  Whisper it not, and I will
7864 tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the
7865 sea.  At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,
7866 leathern tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and
7867 then letting it escape.  But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant
7868 for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join
7869 the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!
7870 
7871 
7872 Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of
7873 the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
7874 large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
7875 thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage.  He was the
7876 elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
7877 days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies.  At
7878 their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
7879 every evening leads on the hosts of light.  The flashing cascade of
7880 his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings
7881 more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished
7882 him.  A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen,
7883 western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters
7884 revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic
7885 as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed.  Whether
7886 marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts
7887 that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether
7888 with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon,
7889 the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils
7890 reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented
7891 himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling
7892 reverence and awe.  Nor can it be questioned from what stands on
7893 legendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual
7894 whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that
7895 this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at
7896 the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
7897 
7898 But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
7899 accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
7900 Albatross.
7901 
7902 What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often
7903 shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and
7904 kin!  It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by
7905 the name he bears.  The Albino is as well made as other men--has no
7906 substantive deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading
7907 whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion.
7908 Why should this be so?
7909 
7910 Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but
7911 not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
7912 crowning attribute of the terrible.  From its snowy aspect, the
7913 gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
7914 Squall.  Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
7915 omitted so potent an auxiliary.  How wildly it heightens the effect
7916 of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of
7917 their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their
7918 bailiff in the market-place!
7919 
7920 Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
7921 mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue.  It
7922 cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
7923 the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
7924 there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
7925 consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here.  And
7926 from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the
7927 shroud in which we wrap them.  Nor even in our superstitions do we
7928 fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts
7929 rising in a milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us
7930 add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the
7931 evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
7932 
7933 Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
7934 thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
7935 idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
7936 
7937 But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
7938 account for it?  To analyse it, would seem impossible.  Can we,
7939 then, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing
7940 of whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part
7941 stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught
7942 fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same
7943 sorcery, however modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some
7944 chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?
7945 
7946 Let us try.  But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
7947 and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.
7948 And though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions
7949 about to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few
7950 perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore
7951 may not be able to recall them now.
7952 
7953 Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
7954 acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
7955 mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
7956 speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
7957 with new-fallen snow?  Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant
7958 of the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a
7959 White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
7960 
7961 Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
7962 kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White
7963 Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
7964 untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its
7965 neighbors--the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?  And those sublimer
7966 towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar
7967 moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare
7968 mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is
7969 full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess?  Or why, irrespective of
7970 all latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert
7971 such a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea
7972 lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on
7973 the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets?
7974 Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to
7975 the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,
7976 does "the tall pale man" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless
7977 pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves--why is
7978 this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the
7979 Blocksburg?
7980 
7981 Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
7982 earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
7983 tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her
7984 wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all
7985 adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban
7986 avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack
7987 of cards;--it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the
7988 strangest, saddest city thou can'st see.  For Lima has taken the
7989 white veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her
7990 woe.  Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new;
7991 admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her
7992 broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own
7993 distortions.
7994 
7995 I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
7996 is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
7997 objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
7998 aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
7999 almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
8000 exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or
8001 universality.  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be
8002 respectively elucidated by the following examples.
8003 
8004 First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
8005 by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
8006 just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
8007 precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock
8008 to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky
8009 whiteness--as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white
8010 bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious
8011 dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him
8012 as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off
8013 soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue
8014 water is under him again.  Yet where is the mariner who will tell
8015 thee, "Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as
8016 the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?"
8017 
8018 Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
8019 snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
8020 mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such
8021 vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it
8022 would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes.  Much the same is
8023 it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative
8024 indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no
8025 shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.  Not
8026 so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at
8027 times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost
8028 and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows
8029 speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless
8030 churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and
8031 splintered crosses.
8032 
8033 But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is
8034 but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
8035 hypo, Ishmael.
8036 
8037 Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley
8038 of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon
8039 the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him,
8040 so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal
8041 muskiness--why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the
8042 ground in phrensies of affright?  There is no remembrance in him of
8043 any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the
8044 strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated
8045 with the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New
8046 England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?
8047 
8048 No; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
8049 knowledge of the demonism in the world.  Though thousands of miles
8050 from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending,
8051 goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the
8052 prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.
8053 
8054 Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings
8055 of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
8056 windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the
8057 shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
8058 
8059 Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the
8060 mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt,
8061 somewhere those things must exist.  Though in many of its aspects
8062 this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were
8063 formed in fright.
8064 
8065 But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
8066 learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
8067 and far more portentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
8068 meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
8069 Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent
8070 in things the most appalling to mankind.
8071 
8072 Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
8073 and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with
8074 the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the
8075 milky way?  Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a
8076 colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the
8077 concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a
8078 dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a
8079 colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink?  And when we
8080 consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all
8081 other earthly hues--every stately or lovely emblazoning--the sweet
8082 tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of
8083 butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are
8084 but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only
8085 laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints
8086 like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the
8087 charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that
8088 the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
8089 principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself,
8090 and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects,
8091 even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this,
8092 the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful
8093 travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
8094 glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind
8095 at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around
8096 him.  And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol.
8097 Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?

8101 CHAPTER 43
8102 
8103 Hark!
8104 
8105 
8106 "HIST!  Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?
8107 
8108 It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing
8109 in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the
8110 waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail.  In this manner, they
8111 passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt.  Standing, for the most
8112 part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were
8113 careful not to speak or rustle their feet.  From hand to hand, the
8114 buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional
8115 flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
8116 
8117 It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
8118 whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
8119 Cholo, the words above.
8120 
8121 "Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"
8122 
8123 "Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?"
8124 
8125 "There it is again--under the hatches--don't you hear it--a cough--it
8126 sounded like a cough."
8127 
8128 "Cough be damned!  Pass along that return bucket."
8129 
8130 "There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three sleepers
8131 turning over, now!"
8132 
8133 "Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye?  It's the three soaked
8134 biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else.
8135 Look to the bucket!"
8136 
8137 "Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears."
8138 
8139 "Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old
8140 Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;
8141 you're the chap."
8142 
8143 "Grin away; we'll see what turns up.  Hark ye, Cabaco, there is
8144 somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;
8145 and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too.  I heard Stubb
8146 tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort
8147 in the wind."
8148 
8149 "Tish! the bucket!"
8150 
8151 
8152 
8153 CHAPTER 44
8154 
8155 The Chart.
8156 
8157 
8158 Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall
8159 that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his
8160 purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the
8161 transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
8162 charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.  Then
8163 seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the
8164 various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but
8165 steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were
8166 blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside
8167 him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on
8168 various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been
8169 captured or seen.
8170 
8171 While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over
8172 his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for
8173 ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled
8174 brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out
8175 lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was
8176 also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his
8177 forehead.
8178 
8179 But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
8180 cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.  Almost every night they
8181 were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,
8182 and others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans
8183 before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a
8184 view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of
8185 his soul.
8186 
8187 Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
8188 it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
8189 creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it
8190 seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and
8191 thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and,
8192 also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting
8193 him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,
8194 almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be
8195 upon this or that ground in search of his prey.
8196 
8197 So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
8198 sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
8199 that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
8200 were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully
8201 collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
8202 correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the
8203 flights of swallows.  On this hint, attempts have been made to
8204 construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*
8205 
8206 
8207 *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
8208 an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National
8209 Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it
8210 appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
8211 portions of it are presented in the circular.  "This chart divides
8212 the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees
8213 of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are
8214 twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
8215 of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days
8216 that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two
8217 others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right,
8218 have been seen."
8219 
8220 
8221 Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,
8222 the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,
8223 secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are
8224 called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
8225 undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any
8226 chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these
8227 cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a
8228 surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly
8229 confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary
8230 VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces
8231 some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to
8232 expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the
8233 whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic
8234 zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and
8235 along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked
8236 for.
8237 
8238 And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
8239 feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in
8240 crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,
8241 by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to
8242 be wholly without prospect of a meeting.
8243 
8244 There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
8245 delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,
8246 perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular
8247 seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude
8248 that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude
8249 this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those
8250 that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar
8251 and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved
8252 true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,
8253 applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm
8254 whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for
8255 example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,
8256 or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that
8257 were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
8258 corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,
8259 too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed
8260 himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and
8261 ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And
8262 where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been
8263 spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,
8264 antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or
8265 place were attained, when all possibilities would become
8266 probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
8267 next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were
8268 conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For
8269 there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
8270 periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the
8271 sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one
8272 sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly
8273 encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were
8274 storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the
8275 monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But
8276 in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with
8277 which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he
8278 would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning
8279 fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;
8280 nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
8281 unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
8282 
8283 Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of
8284 the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her
8285 commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
8286 then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
8287 Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the
8288 next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing
8289 had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this
8290 very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and
8291 sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
8292 of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous
8293 hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far
8294 remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his
8295 wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China
8296 Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,
8297 Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter
8298 and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag
8299 world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.
8300 
8301 But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
8302 not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
8303 solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
8304 individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
8305 in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the
8306 peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could
8307 not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab
8308 would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long
8309 after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,
8310 and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out
8311 like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a
8312 breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came
8313 over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover
8314 his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure
8315 who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps
8316 with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his
8317 palms.
8318 
8319 Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably
8320 vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts
8321 through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and
8322 whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till
8323 the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and
8324 when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved
8325 his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from
8326 which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends
8327 beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself
8328 yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and
8329 with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though
8330 escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of
8331 being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright
8332 at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.
8333 For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast
8334 hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,
8335 was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror
8336 again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;
8337 and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing
8338 mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or
8339 agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity
8340 of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an
8341 integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the
8342 soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up
8343 all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that
8344 purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against
8345 gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its
8346 own.  Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to
8347 which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and
8348 unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of
8349 bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the
8350 time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of
8351 living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
8352 therefore a blankness in itself.  God help thee, old man, thy
8353 thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
8354 thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart
8355 for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.
8356 
8357 
8358 
8359 CHAPTER 45
8360 
8361 The Affidavit.
8362 
8363 
8364 So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
8365 as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
8366 particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
8367 its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this
8368 volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and
8369 more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
8370 and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance
8371 of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural
8372 verity of the main points of this affair.
8373 
8374 I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
8375 content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
8376 items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
8377 these citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally
8378 follow of itself.
8379 
8380 First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
8381 receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
8382 interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by
8383 the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
8384 private cypher, have been taken from the body.  In the instance where
8385 three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and
8386 I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
8387 them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage
8388 to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and
8389 penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of
8390 nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers,
8391 poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to
8392 wandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he
8393 had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice
8394 circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of
8395 Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came
8396 together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have
8397 known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw
8398 the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons
8399 with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead
8400 fish.  In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the
8401 boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly
8402 recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which
8403 I had observed there three years previous.  I say three years, but I
8404 am pretty sure it was more than that.  Here are three instances,
8405 then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many
8406 other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no
8407 good ground to impeach.
8408 
8409 Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however
8410 ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several
8411 memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean
8412 has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.  Why such
8413 a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to
8414 his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for
8415 however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon
8416 put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down
8417 into a peculiarly valuable oil.  No: the reason was this: that from
8418 the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige
8419 of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo
8420 Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him
8421 by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered
8422 lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more
8423 intimate acquaintance.  Like some poor devils ashore that happen to
8424 know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
8425 salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the
8426 acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their
8427 presumption.
8428 
8429 But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
8430 celebrity--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
8431 famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
8432 but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions
8433 of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar.  Was it
8434 not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg,
8435 who so long did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose
8436 spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?  Was it not so, O
8437 New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their
8438 wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so, O Morquan!
8439 King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the
8440 semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?  Was it not so, O
8441 Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with
8442 mystic hieroglyphics upon the back!  In plain prose, here are four
8443 whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
8444 Sylla to the classic scholar.
8445 
8446 But this is not all.  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at
8447 various times creating great havoc among the boats of different
8448 vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out,
8449 chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their
8450 anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out
8451 through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his
8452 mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost
8453 warrior of the Indian King Philip.
8454 
8455 I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
8456 mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
8457 printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
8458 whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe.  For
8459 this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires
8460 full as much bolstering as error.  So ignorant are most landsmen of
8461 some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that
8462 without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and
8463 otherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a
8464 monstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and
8465 intolerable allegory.
8466 
8467 First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
8468 perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed,
8469 vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they
8470 recur.  One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual
8471 disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a
8472 public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten
8473 that record.  Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this
8474 moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea,
8475 is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding
8476 leviathan--do you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in
8477 the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?
8478 No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.
8479 In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct
8480 or indirect from New Guinea?  Yet I tell you that upon one particular
8481 voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty
8482 different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some
8483 of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew.
8484 For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a
8485 gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for
8486 it.
8487 
8488 Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale
8489 is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that
8490 when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
8491 enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my
8492 facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of
8493 being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues
8494 of Egypt.
8495 
8496 But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
8497 testimony entirely independent of my own.  That point is this: The
8498 Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and
8499 judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,
8500 utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm
8501 Whale HAS done it.
8502 
8503 First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of
8504 Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw
8505 spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.
8506 Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very
8507 large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore
8508 directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,
8509 he so stove her in, that in less than "ten minutes" she settled down
8510 and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.
8511 After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in
8512 their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more
8513 sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
8514 shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second
8515 time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he
8516 has never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a
8517 resident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of
8518 the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and
8519 faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this
8520 within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*
8521 
8522 
8523 *The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: "Every fact
8524 seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance
8525 which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the
8526 ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to
8527 their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being
8528 made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for
8529 the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were
8530 necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
8531 resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had
8532 just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his
8533 companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings."  Again:
8534 "At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening
8535 before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my
8536 mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many
8537 of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied
8538 that I am correct in my opinion."
8539 
8540 Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a
8541 black night an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
8542 hospitable shore.  "The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing;
8543 the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed
8544 upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
8545 contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the
8546 dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,
8547 wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its
8548 appearance."
8549 
8550 In another place--p. 45,--he speaks of "THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL
8551 ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL."
8552 
8553 
8554 Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807
8555 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
8556 particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
8557 though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual
8558 allusions to it.
8559 
8560 Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then
8561 commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to
8562 be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship
8563 in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.  Conversation turning upon
8564 whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the
8565 amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen
8566 present.  He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so
8567 smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a
8568 thimbleful.  Very good; but there is more coming.  Some weeks after,
8569 the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.  But
8570 he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few
8571 moments' confidential business with him.  That business consisted in
8572 fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps
8573 going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair.
8574 I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore's interview
8575 with that whale as providential.  Was not Saul of Tarsus converted
8576 from unbelief by a similar fright?  I tell you, the sperm whale will
8577 stand no nonsense.
8578 
8579 I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little
8580 circumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.
8581 Langsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the Russian
8582 Admiral Krusenstern's famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of
8583 the present century.  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth
8584 chapter:
8585 
8586 "By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next
8587 day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather
8588 was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged
8589 to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;
8590 it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest
8591 sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger
8592 than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was
8593 not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,
8594 which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was
8595 impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed
8596 in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up
8597 its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The
8598 masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
8599 all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck
8600 upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with
8601 the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately
8602 to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any
8603 damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped
8604 entirely uninjured."
8605 
8606 Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
8607 question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
8608 adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
8609 Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.
8610 I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in
8611 Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by
8612 no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,
8613 and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he
8614 sailed from home.
8615 
8616 In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,
8617 too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
8618 Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that
8619 just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here
8620 for a corroborative example, if such be needed.
8621 
8622 Lionel, it seems, was on his way to "John Ferdinando," as he calls
8623 the modern Juan Fernandes.  "In our way thither," he says, "about
8624 four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
8625 leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,
8626 which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell
8627 where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for
8628 death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we
8629 took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the
8630 amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found
8631 no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in
8632 their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their
8633 hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown
8634 out of his cabin!"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an
8635 earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that
8636 a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
8637 mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in
8638 the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after
8639 all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from
8640 beneath.
8641 
8642 I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known
8643 to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In
8644 more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the
8645 assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,
8646 and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The
8647 English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for
8648 his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the
8649 lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been
8650 transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her
8651 great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.
8652 Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once
8653 struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with
8654 blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
8655 pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
8656 character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his
8657 mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive
8658 minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding
8659 illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you
8660 will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in
8661 this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that
8662 these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so
8663 that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is
8664 nothing new under the sun.
8665 
8666 In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian
8667 magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor
8668 and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his
8669 own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best
8670 authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and
8671 unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not
8672 at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.
8673 
8674 Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term
8675 of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
8676 in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having
8677 destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more
8678 than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot
8679 easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what
8680 precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he
8681 destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a
8682 whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will
8683 tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had
8684 been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters
8685 connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
8686 and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a
8687 place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations
8688 have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been
8689 isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the
8690 Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary
8691 coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a
8692 sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the
8693 Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out
8694 of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
8695 
8696 In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
8697 substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
8698 But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
8699 whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
8700 large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
8701 found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements
8702 together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
8703 according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for
8704 half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all
8705 probability have been a sperm whale.
8706 
8707 
8708 
8709 CHAPTER 46
8710 
8711 Surmises.
8712 
8713 
8714 Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
8715 thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby
8716 Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to
8717 that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature
8718 and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,
8719 altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or
8720 at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives
8721 much more influential with him.  It would be refining too much,
8722 perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his
8723 vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended
8724 itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters
8725 he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each
8726 subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he
8727 hunted.  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there
8728 were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly
8729 according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no
8730 means incapable of swaying him.
8731 
8732 To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used
8733 in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.  He
8734 knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some
8735 respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the
8736 complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority
8737 involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the
8738 intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.  Starbuck's
8739 body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept
8740 his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this the
8741 chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he,
8742 would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.
8743 It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was
8744 seen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall
8745 into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,
8746 unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were
8747 brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of
8748 Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested
8749 than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for
8750 the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange
8751 imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full
8752 terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
8753 background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted
8754 meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long
8755 night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
8756 think of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly and impetuously the
8757 savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors
8758 of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in
8759 the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when
8760 retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
8761 promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
8762 requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene
8763 and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
8764 
8765 Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion
8766 mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are
8767 evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the
8768 manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the
8769 White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and
8770 playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous
8771 knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give
8772 chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,
8773 daily appetites.  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of
8774 old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to
8775 fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
8776 picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.  Had
8777 they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object--that
8778 final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in
8779 disgust.  I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of
8780 cash--aye, cash.  They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by,
8781 and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same
8782 quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
8783 soon cashier Ahab.
8784 
8785 Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
8786 to Ahab personally.  Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
8787 somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
8788 Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,
8789 he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
8790 usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
8791 if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
8792 obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.
8793 From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the
8794 possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,
8795 Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.  That
8796 protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and
8797 heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
8798 every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew
8799 to be subjected to.
8800 
8801 For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
8802 verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a
8803 good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the
8804 Pequod's voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but
8805 force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the
8806 general pursuit of his profession.
8807 
8808 Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the
8809 three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and
8810 not omit reporting even a porpoise.  This vigilance was not long
8811 without reward.
8812 
8813 
8814 
8815 CHAPTER 47
8816 
8817 The Mat-Maker.
8818 
8819 
8820 It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
8821 about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured
8822 waters.  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a
8823 sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat.  So still and
8824 subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an
8825 incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor
8826 seemed resolved into his own invisible self.
8827 
8828 I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.  As I
8829 kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the
8830 long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
8831 Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
8832 between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
8833 and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a
8834 dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the
8835 sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it
8836 seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle
8837 mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  There lay the
8838 fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning,
8839 unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of
8840 the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.  This warp
8841 seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own
8842 shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.
8843 Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting
8844 the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the
8845 case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow
8846 producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the
8847 completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally
8848 shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword
8849 must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and necessity--nowise
8850 incompatible--all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp
8851 of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course--its every
8852 alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still
8853 free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though
8854 restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and
8855 sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed
8856 to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring
8857 blow at events.
8858 
8859 
8860 Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
8861 strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball
8862 of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the
8863 clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.  High aloft in the
8864 cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego.  His body was reaching
8865 eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief
8866 sudden intervals he continued his cries.  To be sure the same sound
8867 was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from
8868 hundreds of whalemen's look-outs perched as high in the air; but from
8869 few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a
8870 marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian's.
8871 
8872 As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
8873 eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
8874 prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild
8875 cries announcing their coming.
8876 
8877 "There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!"
8878 
8879 "Where-away?"
8880 
8881 "On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!"
8882 
8883 Instantly all was commotion.
8884 
8885 The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
8886 reliable uniformity.  And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
8887 other tribes of his genus.
8888 
8889 "There go flukes!" was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
8890 disappeared.
8891 
8892 "Quick, steward!" cried Ahab.  "Time! time!"
8893 
8894 Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
8895 minute to Ahab.
8896 
8897 The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
8898 before it.  Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading
8899 to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in
8900 advance of our bows.  For that singular craft at times evinced by the
8901 Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he
8902 nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and
8903 swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his
8904 could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that
8905 the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew
8906 at all of our vicinity.  One of the men selected for
8907 shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time
8908 relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.  The sailors at the fore
8909 and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places;
8910 the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three
8911 boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high
8912 cliffs.  Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
8913 clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the
8914 gunwale.  So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw
8915 themselves on board an enemy's ship.
8916 
8917 But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
8918 every eye from the whale.  With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who
8919 was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of
8920 air.
8921 
8922 
8923 
8924 CHAPTER 48
8925 
8926 The First Lowering.
8927 
8928 
8929 The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other
8930 side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose
8931 the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.  This boat had
8932 always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called
8933 the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.
8934 The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one
8935 white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.  A rumpled
8936 Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide
8937 black trowsers of the same dark stuff.  But strangely crowning this
8938 ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair
8939 braided and coiled round and round upon his head.  Less swart in
8940 aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
8941 tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of
8942 the Manillas;--a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,
8943 and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and
8944 secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord,
8945 whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.
8946 
8947 While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these
8948 strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their
8949 head, "All ready there, Fedallah?"
8950 
8951 "Ready," was the half-hissed reply.
8952 
8953 "Lower away then; d'ye hear?" shouting across the deck.  "Lower away
8954 there, I say."
8955 
8956 Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the
8957 men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks;
8958 with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a
8959 dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
8960 sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the
8961 tossed boats below.
8962 
8963 Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth
8964 keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern,
8965 and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the
8966 stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves
8967 widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.  But with all their
8968 eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates
8969 of the other boats obeyed not the command.
8970 
8971 "Captain Ahab?--" said Starbuck.
8972 
8973 "Spread yourselves," cried Ahab; "give way, all four boats.  Thou,
8974 Flask, pull out more to leeward!"
8975 
8976 "Aye, aye, sir," cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
8977 great steering oar.  "Lay back!" addressing his crew.
8978 "There!--there!--there again!  There she blows right ahead,
8979 boys!--lay back!"
8980 
8981 "Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."
8982 
8983 "Oh, I don't mind'em, sir," said Archy; "I knew it all before now.
8984 Didn't I hear 'em in the hold?  And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it?
8985 What say ye, Cabaco?  They are stowaways, Mr. Flask."
8986 
8987 "Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
8988 ones," drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of
8989 whom still showed signs of uneasiness.  "Why don't you break your
8990 backbones, my boys?  What is it you stare at?  Those chaps in yonder
8991 boat?  Tut!  They are only five more hands come to help us--never
8992 mind from where--the more the merrier.  Pull, then, do pull; never
8993 mind the brimstone--devils are good fellows enough.  So, so; there
8994 you are now; that's the stroke for a thousand pounds; that's the
8995 stroke to sweep the stakes!  Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my
8996 heroes!  Three cheers, men--all hearts alive!  Easy, easy; don't be
8997 in a hurry--don't be in a hurry.  Why don't you snap your oars, you
8998 rascals?  Bite something, you dogs!  So, so, so, then:--softly,
8999 softly!  That's it--that's it! long and strong.  Give way there, give
9000 way!  The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all
9001 asleep.  Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.  Pull, will ye? pull,
9002 can't ye? pull, won't ye?  Why in the name of gudgeons and
9003 ginger-cakes don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and
9004 start your eyes out!  Here!" whipping out the sharp knife from his
9005 girdle; "every mother's son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the
9006 blade between his teeth.  That's it--that's it.  Now ye do something;
9007 that looks like it, my steel-bits.  Start her--start her, my
9008 silver-spoons!  Start her, marling-spikes!"
9009 
9010 Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
9011 rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially
9012 in inculcating the religion of rowing.  But you must not suppose from
9013 this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright
9014 passions with his congregation.  Not at all; and therein consisted
9015 his chief peculiarity.  He would say the most terrific things to his
9016 crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury
9017 seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman
9018 could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and
9019 yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.  Besides he all the time
9020 looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his
9021 steering-oar, and so broadly gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the
9022 mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast,
9023 acted like a charm upon the crew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those
9024 odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously
9025 ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of
9026 obeying them.
9027 
9028 In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
9029 across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
9030 pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
9031 
9032 "Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
9033 please!"
9034 
9035 "Halloa!" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
9036 spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
9037 like a flint from Stubb's.
9038 
9039 "What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!
9040 
9041 "Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
9042 boys!)" in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: "A
9043 sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never
9044 mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.  Let all your crew pull strong,
9045 come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of sperm
9046 ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!)
9047 Sperm, sperm's the play!  This at least is duty; duty and profit hand
9048 in hand."
9049 
9050 "Aye, aye, I thought as much," soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
9051 diverged, "as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, I thought so.  Aye, and
9052 that's what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy
9053 long suspected.  They were hidden down there.  The White Whale's at
9054 the bottom of it.  Well, well, so be it!  Can't be helped!  All
9055 right!  Give way, men!  It ain't the White Whale to-day!  Give way!"
9056 
9057 Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical
9058 instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not
9059 unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of
9060 the ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time
9061 previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this
9062 had in some small measure prepared them for the event.  It took off
9063 the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and
9064 Stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were
9065 for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair
9066 still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to
9067 dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning.  For me,
9068 I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on
9069 board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
9070 enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.
9071 
9072 Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
9073 furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
9074 circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him.  Those
9075 tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like
9076 five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of
9077 strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a
9078 horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.  As for
9079 Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown
9080 aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole
9081 part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the
9082 alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end
9083 of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward
9084 into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was
9085 seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat
9086 lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him.  All at once the
9087 outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,
9088 while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.  Boat and
9089 crew sat motionless on the sea.  Instantly the three spread boats in
9090 the rear paused on their way.  The whales had irregularly settled
9091 bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token
9092 of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed
9093 it.
9094 
9095 "Every man look out along his oars!" cried Starbuck.  "Thou,
9096 Queequeg, stand up!"
9097 
9098 Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the
9099 savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off
9100 towards the spot where the chase had last been descried.  Likewise
9101 upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly
9102 platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly
9103 and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of
9104 a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.
9105 
9106 Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still;
9107 its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a
9108 stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above
9109 the level of the stern platform.  It is used for catching turns with
9110 the whale line.  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a
9111 man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed
9112 perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her
9113 trucks.  But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same
9114 time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that
9115 this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.
9116 
9117 "I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
9118 that."
9119 
9120 Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
9121 way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his
9122 lofty shoulders for a pedestal.
9123 
9124 "Good a mast-head as any, sir.  Will you mount?"
9125 
9126 "That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
9127 fifty feet taller."
9128 
9129 Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
9130 boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm
9131 to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed
9132 head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one
9133 dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.
9134 And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm
9135 furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself
9136 by.
9137 
9138 At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what
9139 wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an
9140 erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most
9141 riotously perverse and cross-running seas.  Still more strange to see
9142 him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such
9143 circumstances.  But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic
9144 Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool,
9145 indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to
9146 every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form.  On his
9147 broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake.  The bearer
9148 looked nobler than the rider.  Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,
9149 ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;
9150 but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly
9151 chest.  So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living
9152 magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her
9153 seasons for that.
9154 
9155 Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
9156 solicitudes.  The whales might have made one of their regular
9157 soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were
9158 the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to
9159 solace the languishing interval with his pipe.  He withdrew it from
9160 his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather.  He
9161 loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly
9162 had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand,
9163 when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to
9164 windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his
9165 erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry,
9166 "Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!"
9167 
9168 To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
9169 visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
9170 water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and
9171 suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
9172 rolling billows.  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
9173 were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.  Beneath
9174 this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin
9175 layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance of
9176 all the other indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed
9177 their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.
9178 
9179 All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
9180 water and air.  But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,
9181 as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
9182 hills.
9183 
9184 "Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
9185 intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed
9186 glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed
9187 as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.  He did
9188 not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to
9189 him.  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly
9190 pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now
9191 soft with entreaty.
9192 
9193 How different the loud little King-Post.  "Sing out and say
9194 something, my hearties.  Roar and pull, my thunderbolts!  Beach me,
9195 beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll
9196 sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including
9197 wife and children, boys.  Lay me on--lay me on!  O Lord, Lord! but I
9198 shall go stark, staring mad!  See! see that white water!"  And so
9199 shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on
9200 it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally
9201 fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt
9202 from the prairie.
9203 
9204 "Look at that chap now," philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
9205 unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
9206 short distance, followed after--"He's got fits, that Flask has.
9207 Fits? yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em.
9208 Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive.  Pudding for supper, you
9209 know;--merry's the word.  Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all.
9210 But what the devil are you hurrying about?  Softly, softly, and
9211 steadily, my men.  Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.  Crack
9212 all your backbones, and bite your knives in two--that's all.  Take it
9213 easy--why don't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and
9214 lungs!"
9215 
9216 But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew
9217 of his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the
9218 blessed light of the evangelical land.  Only the infidel sharks in
9219 the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado
9220 brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after
9221 his prey.
9222 
9223 Meanwhile, all the boats tore on.  The repeated specific allusions of
9224 Flask to "that whale," as he called the fictitious monster which he
9225 declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its
9226 tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like,
9227 that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful
9228 look over the shoulder.  But this was against all rule; for the
9229 oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their
9230 necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and
9231 no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.
9232 
9233 It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe!  The vast swells of the
9234 omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
9235 along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
9236 bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip
9237 for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that
9238 almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip
9239 into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to
9240 gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down
9241 its other side;--all these, with the cries of the headsmen and
9242 harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the
9243 wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with
9244 outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;--all
9245 this was thrilling.
9246 
9247 Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the
9248 fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering
9249 the first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can
9250 feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the
9251 first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of
9252 the hunted sperm whale.
9253 
9254 The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
9255 more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun
9256 cloud-shadows flung upon the sea.  The jets of vapour no longer
9257 blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed
9258 separating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck
9259 giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.  Our sail was
9260 now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat
9261 going with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could
9262 scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the
9263 row-locks.
9264 
9265 Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
9266 ship nor boat to be seen.
9267 
9268 "Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the
9269 sheet of his sail; "there is time to kill a fish yet before the
9270 squall comes.  There's white water again!--close to!  Spring!"
9271 
9272 Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
9273 that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard,
9274 when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: "Stand
9275 up!" and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
9276 
9277 Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death
9278 peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense
9279 countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the
9280 imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing
9281 sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.  Meanwhile the
9282 boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and
9283 hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.
9284 
9285 "That's his hump.  THERE, THERE, give it to him!" whispered Starbuck.
9286 
9287 A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron
9288 of Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push
9289 from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the
9290 sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near
9291 by; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.  The
9292 whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter
9293 into the white curdling cream of the squall.  Squall, whale, and
9294 harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the
9295 iron, escaped.
9296 
9297 Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming
9298 round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the
9299 gunwale, tumbled back to our places.  There we sat up to our knees in
9300 the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our
9301 downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up
9302 to us from the bottom of the ocean.
9303 
9304 The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers
9305 together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us
9306 like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were
9307 burning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we hailed the
9308 other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a
9309 flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.  Meanwhile the
9310 driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;
9311 no sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all
9312 attempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,
9313 performing now the office of life-preservers.  So, cutting the
9314 lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck
9315 contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a
9316 waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this
9317 forlorn hope.  There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle
9318 in the heart of that almighty forlornness.  There, then, he sat, the
9319 sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in
9320 the midst of despair.
9321 
9322 Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or
9323 boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist still
9324 spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of
9325 the boat.  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand
9326 to his ear.  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards
9327 hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the
9328 thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we
9329 all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing
9330 right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its
9331 length.
9332 
9333 Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant
9334 it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base
9335 of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen
9336 no more till it came up weltering astern.  Again we swam for it, were
9337 dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely
9338 landed on board.  Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had
9339 cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.  The
9340 ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light
9341 upon some token of our perishing,--an oar or a lance pole.
9342

9344 
9345 CHAPTER 49
9346 
9347 The Hyena.
9348 
9349 
9350 There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
9351 affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
9352 practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and
9353 more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.
9354 However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing.
9355 He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions,
9356 all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an
9357 ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.  And
9358 as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden
9359 disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem
9360 to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side
9361 bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker.  That odd sort of
9362 wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of
9363 extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness,
9364 so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most
9365 momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.  There is
9366 nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort
9367 of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this
9368 whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.
9369 
9370 "Queequeg," said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
9371 deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
9372 water; "Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often
9373 happen?"  Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me,
9374 he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.
9375 
9376 "Mr. Stubb," said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
9377 oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; "Mr. Stubb,
9378 I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our
9379 chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent.  I
9380 suppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set
9381 in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?"
9382 
9383 "Certain.  I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off
9384 Cape Horn."
9385 
9386 "Mr. Flask," said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing
9387 close by; "you are experienced in these things, and I am not.  Will
9388 you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr.
9389 Flask, for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself
9390 back-foremost into death's jaws?"
9391 
9392 "Can't you twist that smaller?" said Flask.  "Yes, that's the law.  I
9393 should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face
9394 foremost.  Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
9395 that!"
9396 
9397 Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate
9398 statement of the entire case.  Considering, therefore, that squalls
9399 and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep,
9400 were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering
9401 that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I
9402 must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the
9403 boat--oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his
9404 impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own
9405 frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster to our
9406 own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving
9407 on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
9408 Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in
9409 the fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent
9410 Starbuck's boat; and finally considering in what a devil's chase I
9411 was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together,
9412 I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of
9413 my will.  "Queequeg," said I, "come along, you shall be my lawyer,
9414 executor, and legatee."
9415 
9416 It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
9417 their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
9418 more fond of that diversion.  This was the fourth time in my nautical
9419 life that I had done the same thing.  After the ceremony was
9420 concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone
9421 was rolled away from my heart.  Besides, all the days I should now
9422 live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his
9423 resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks
9424 as the case might be.  I survived myself; my death and burial were
9425 locked up in my chest.  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly,
9426 like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of
9427 a snug family vault.
9428 
9429 Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my
9430 frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction,
9431 and the devil fetch the hindmost.
9432 
9433 
9434 
9435 CHAPTER 50
9436 
9437 Ahab's Boat and Crew.  Fedallah.
9438 
9439 
9440 "Who would have thought it, Flask!" cried Stubb; "if I had but one
9441 leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the
9442 plug-hole with my timber toe.  Oh! he's a wonderful old man!"
9443 
9444 "I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account," said
9445 Flask.  "If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different
9446 thing.  That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of
9447 the other left, you know."
9448 
9449 "I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel."
9450 
9451 
9452 Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
9453 the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it
9454 is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active
9455 perils of the chase.  So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears
9456 in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be
9457 carried into the thickest of the fight.
9458 
9459 But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.  Considering
9460 that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of
9461 danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great
9462 and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed,
9463 then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any
9464 maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?  As a general thing,
9465 the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
9466 
9467 Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little
9468 of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes
9469 of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and
9470 giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat
9471 actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above
9472 all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same
9473 boat's crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the
9474 heads of the owners of the Pequod.  Therefore he had not solicited a
9475 boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on
9476 that head.  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own
9477 touching all that matter.  Until Cabaco's published discovery, the
9478 sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a
9479 little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary
9480 business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after
9481 this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
9482 making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one
9483 of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden
9484 skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the
9485 groove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and
9486 particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in
9487 the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed
9488 pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in
9489 exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes
9490 called, the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee
9491 against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
9492 often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
9493 semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter's
9494 chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there;
9495 all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at
9496 the time.  But almost everybody supposed that this particular
9497 preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the
9498 ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his
9499 intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.  But such a
9500 supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any
9501 boat's crew being assigned to that boat.
9502 
9503 Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
9504 away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane.  Besides, now and then such
9505 unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the
9506 unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating
9507 outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer
9508 castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits
9509 of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and
9510 what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step
9511 down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create
9512 any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.
9513 
9514 But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
9515 phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it
9516 were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah
9517 remained a muffled mystery to the last.  Whence he came in a mannerly
9518 world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced
9519 himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to
9520 have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might
9521 have been even authority over him; all this none knew.  But one
9522 cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah.  He was such a
9523 creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see
9524 in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and
9525 then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the
9526 Oriental isles to the east of the continent--those insulated,
9527 immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days
9528 still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal
9529 generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct
9530 recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came,
9531 eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon
9532 why they were created and to what end; when though, according to
9533 Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the
9534 devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.
9535 
9536 
9537 
9538 CHAPTER 51
9539 
9540 The Spirit-Spout.
9541 
9542 
9543 Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
9544 swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off
9545 the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of
9546 the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
9547 locality, southerly from St. Helena.
9548 
9549 It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
9550 moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
9551 and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
9552 silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was
9553 seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow.  Lit up by the
9554 moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god
9555 uprising from the sea.  Fedallah first descried this jet.  For of
9556 these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast
9557 head, and stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it
9558 had been day.  And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night,
9559 not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.  You
9560 may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old
9561 Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the
9562 moon, companions in one sky.  But when, after spending his uniform
9563 interval there for several successive nights without uttering a
9564 single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was
9565 heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner
9566 started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the
9567 rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.  "There she blows!"  Had the
9568 trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still
9569 they felt no terror; rather pleasure.  For though it was a most
9570 unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
9571 exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
9572 lowering.
9573 
9574 Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
9575 t'gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread.  The
9576 best man in the ship must take the helm.  Then, with every mast-head
9577 manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind.  The strange,
9578 upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the
9579 hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel
9580 like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two
9581 antagonistic influences were struggling in her--one to mount direct
9582 to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.  And
9583 had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that
9584 in him also two different things were warring.  While his one live
9585 leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb
9586 sounded like a coffin-tap.  On life and death this old man walked.
9587 But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like
9588 arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen
9589 that night.  Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second
9590 time.
9591 
9592 This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some
9593 days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced:
9594 again it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it,
9595 once more it disappeared as if it had never been.  And so it served
9596 us night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.
9597 Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the
9598 case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or
9599 three; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be
9600 advancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet
9601 seemed for ever alluring us on.
9602 
9603 Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
9604 with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things
9605 invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore
9606 that whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in
9607 however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was
9608 cast by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick.  For a time,
9609 there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting
9610 apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in
9611 order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last
9612 in the remotest and most savage seas.
9613 
9614 These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
9615 wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in
9616 which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a
9617 devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas
9618 so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our
9619 vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like
9620 prow.
9621 
9622 But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
9623 howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
9624 that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the
9625 blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
9626 silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
9627 desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more
9628 dismal than before.
9629 
9630 Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and
9631 thither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable
9632 sea-ravens.  And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these
9633 birds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a long time
9634 obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some
9635 drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and
9636 therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves.  And heaved
9637 and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast
9638 tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish
9639 and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.
9640 
9641 Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye?  Rather Cape Tormentoto, as
9642 called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that
9643 before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this
9644 tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and
9645 these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any
9646 haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.  But
9647 calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of
9648 feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary
9649 jet would at times be descried.
9650 
9651 During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for
9652 the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous
9653 deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
9654 addressed his mates.  In tempestuous times like these, after
9655 everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done
9656 but passively to await the issue of the gale.  Then Captain and crew
9657 become practical fatalists.  So, with his ivory leg inserted into its
9658 accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
9659 hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
9660 occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very
9661 eyelashes together.  Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part
9662 of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
9663 stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to
9664 guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
9665 sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a
9666 loosened belt.  Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as
9667 if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through
9668 all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.  By night
9669 the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean
9670 prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still
9671 wordless Ahab stood up to the blast.  Even when wearied nature seemed
9672 demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock.
9673 Never could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night
9674 going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him
9675 with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the
9676 rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time
9677 before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and
9678 coat.  On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of
9679 tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.  His lantern
9680 swung from his tightly clenched hand.  Though the body was erect, the
9681 head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the
9682 needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*
9683 
9684 
9685 *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to
9686 the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself
9687 of the course of the ship.
9688 
9689 
9690 Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
9691 gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.
9692 
9693 
9694 
9695 CHAPTER 52
9696 
9697 The Albatross.
9698 
9699 
9700 South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good
9701 cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney
9702 (Albatross) by name.  As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at
9703 the fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to
9704 a tyro in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent
9705 from home.
9706 
9707 As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
9708 skeleton of a stranded walrus.  All down her sides, this spectral
9709 appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all
9710 her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees
9711 furred over with hoar-frost.  Only her lower sails were set.  A wild
9712 sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three
9713 mast-heads.  They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and
9714 bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of
9715 cruising.  Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and
9716 swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided
9717 close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each
9718 other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
9719 ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen,
9720 mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own
9721 look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.
9722 
9723 "Ship ahoy!  Have ye seen the White Whale?"
9724 
9725 But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in
9726 the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his
9727 hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove
9728 to make himself heard without it.  Meantime his ship was still
9729 increasing the distance between.  While in various silent ways
9730 the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this
9731 ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale's name
9732 to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though
9733 he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the
9734 threatening wind forbade.  But taking advantage of his windward
9735 position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that
9736 the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he
9737 loudly hailed--"Ahoy there!  This is the Pequod, bound round the
9738 world!  Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean!
9739 and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address
9740 them to--"
9741 
9742 At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly,
9743 then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small
9744 harmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly swimming
9745 by our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged
9746 themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks.  Though in the
9747 course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed
9748 a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles
9749 capriciously carry meanings.
9750 
9751 "Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the
9752 water.  There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed
9753 more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before
9754 evinced.  But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding
9755 the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old
9756 lion voice,--"Up helm!  Keep her off round the world!"
9757 
9758 Round the world!  There is much in that sound to inspire proud
9759 feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct?  Only
9760 through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where
9761 those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.
9762 
9763 Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could
9764 for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and
9765 strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were
9766 promise in the voyage.  But in pursuit of those far mysteries we
9767 dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time
9768 or other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this
9769 round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave
9770 us whelmed.
9771 
9772 
9773 
9774 CHAPTER 53
9775 
9776 The Gam.
9777 
9778 
9779 The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we
9780 had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms.  But even had
9781 this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
9782 her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it
9783 had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative
9784 answer to the question he put.  For, as it eventually turned out, he
9785 cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger
9786 captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so
9787 absorbingly sought.  But all this might remain inadequately
9788 estimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of
9789 whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and
9790 especially on a common cruising-ground.
9791 
9792 If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
9793 equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
9794 each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
9795 them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a
9796 moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a
9797 while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon
9798 the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two
9799 whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off
9800 lone Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more
9801 natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not
9802 only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
9803 sociable contact.  And especially would this seem to be a matter of
9804 course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
9805 captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
9806 each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things
9807 to talk about.
9808 
9809 For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters
9810 on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers
9811 of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
9812 thumb-worn files.  And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
9813 ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
9814 cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
9815 importance to her.  And in degree, all this will hold true concerning
9816 whaling vessels crossing each other's track on the cruising-ground
9817 itself, even though they are equally long absent from home.  For one
9818 of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and
9819 now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the
9820 people of the ship she now meets.  Besides, they would exchange the
9821 whaling news, and have an agreeable chat.  For not only would they
9822 meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the
9823 peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually
9824 shared privations and perils.
9825 
9826 Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
9827 that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
9828 with Americans and English.  Though, to be sure, from the small
9829 number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and
9830 when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between
9831 them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he
9832 does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.  Besides,
9833 the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan
9834 superiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean
9835 Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of
9836 sea-peasant.  But where this superiority in the English whalemen
9837 does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees
9838 in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English,
9839 collectively, in ten years.  But this is a harmless little foible in
9840 the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much
9841 to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles
9842 himself.
9843 
9844 So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
9845 whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so.  Whereas,
9846 some merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic,
9847 will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of
9848 recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a
9849 brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in
9850 finical criticism upon each other's rig.  As for Men-of-War, when
9851 they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of
9852 silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there
9853 does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly
9854 love about it at all.  As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are
9855 in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as
9856 possible.  And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other's
9857 cross-bones, the first hail is--"How many skulls?"--the same way that
9858 whalers hail--"How many barrels?"  And that question once answered,
9859 pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on
9860 both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of each other's villanous
9861 likenesses.
9862 
9863 But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
9864 free-and-easy whaler!  What does the whaler do when she meets another
9865 whaler in any sort of decent weather?  She has a "GAM," a thing so
9866 utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
9867 even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,
9868 and repeat gamesome stuff about "spouters" and "blubber-boilers," and
9869 such like pretty exclamations.  Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,
9870 and also all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors,
9871 cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a
9872 question it would be hard to answer.  Because, in the case of
9873 pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs
9874 has any peculiar glory about it.  It sometimes ends in uncommon
9875 elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows.  And besides, when a man
9876 is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his
9877 superior altitude.  Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be
9878 high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no
9879 solid basis to stand on.
9880 
9881 But what is a GAM?  You might wear out your index-finger running up
9882 and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word.  Dr.
9883 Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not
9884 hold it.  Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many
9885 years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born
9886 Yankees.  Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be
9887 incorporated into the Lexicon.  With that view, let me learnedly
9888 define it.
9889 
9890 GAM.  NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY
9891 ON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE
9892 VISITS BY BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON
9893 BOARD OF ONE SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.
9894 
9895 There is another little item about Gamming which must not be
9896 forgotten here.  All professions have their own little peculiarities
9897 of detail; so has the whale fishery.  In a pirate, man-of-war, or
9898 slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always
9899 sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat
9900 there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's
9901 tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.  But the whale-boat has
9902 no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.
9903 High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water
9904 on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.  And as for a
9905 tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and
9906 therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship,
9907 and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that
9908 subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,
9909 having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing
9910 like a pine tree.  And often you will notice that being conscious of
9911 the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of
9912 the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance
9913 of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.  Nor is this any
9914 very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering
9915 oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar
9916 reciprocating by rapping his knees in front.  He is thus completely
9917 wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by
9918 settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of
9919 the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
9920 foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.  Merely make a
9921 spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.  Then,
9922 again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes,
9923 it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen
9924 steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything
9925 with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,
9926 he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps
9927 being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for
9928 ballast.  Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well
9929 authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an
9930 uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say--to seize
9931 hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim
9932 death.

9937 
9938 The Town-Ho's Story.
9939 
9940 
9941 (AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)
9942 
9943 
9944 The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there,
9945 is much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you
9946 meet more travellers than in any other part.
9947 
9948 It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
9949 homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered.  She was
9950 manned almost wholly by Polynesians.  In the short gam that ensued
9951 she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.  To some the general interest
9952 in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the
9953 Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a
9954 certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called
9955 judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men.  This
9956 latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming
9957 what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be
9958 narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates.  For
9959 that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the
9960 Town-Ho himself.  It was the private property of three confederate
9961 white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to
9962 Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night
9963 Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that
9964 way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
9965 Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those
9966 seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by
9967 such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this
9968 matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never
9969 transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast.  Interweaving in its proper
9970 place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the
9971 ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on
9972 lasting record.
9973 
9974 
9975 *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the
9976 mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos
9977 terrapin.
9978 
9979 
9980 For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once
9981 narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one
9982 saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden
9983 Inn.  Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian,
9984 were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions
9985 they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.
9986 
9987 "Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am
9988 about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of
9989 Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days'
9990 sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn.  She was
9991 somewhere to the northward of the Line.  One morning upon handling
9992 the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made
9993 more water in her hold than common.  They supposed a sword-fish had
9994 stabbed her, gentlemen.  But the captain, having some unusual reason
9995 for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and
9996 therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then
9997 considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it
9998 after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy
9999 weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working
10000 at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more
10001 days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it
10002 sensibly increased.  So much so, that now taking some alarm, the
10003 captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the
10004 islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.
10005 
10006 "Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
10007 favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the
10008 way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
10009 relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep
10010 the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her.  In
10011 truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very
10012 prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in
10013 perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least
10014 fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the
10015 mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,
10016 a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.
10017 
10018 "'Lakeman!--Buffalo!  Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?'
10019 said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
10020 
10021 "On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave your
10022 courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that.  Now,
10023 gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
10024 large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
10025 Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had
10026 yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions
10027 popularly connected with the open ocean.  For in their interflowing
10028 aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and Ontario,
10029 and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,--possess an ocean-like
10030 expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of
10031 its rimmed varieties of races and of climes.  They contain round
10032 archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in
10033 large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the
10034 Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous
10035 territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks;
10036 here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like
10037 craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings
10038 of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild
10039 barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry
10040 wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered
10041 forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in
10042 Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of
10043 prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar
10044 Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as
10045 well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant
10046 ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech
10047 canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as
10048 any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out
10049 of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a
10050 midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.  Thus, gentlemen, though
10051 an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;
10052 as much of an audacious mariner as any.  And for Radney, though in
10053 his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to
10054 nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed
10055 our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite
10056 as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh
10057 from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives.  Yet was this
10058 Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
10059 mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible
10060 firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition
10061 which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had
10062 long been retained harmless and docile.  At all events, he had proved
10063 so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,
10064 gentlemen, you shall hear.
10065 
10066 "It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her
10067 prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again
10068 increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
10069 every day.  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like
10070 our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping
10071 their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should
10072 the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect,
10073 the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
10074 remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
10075 Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,
10076 gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at
10077 their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable
10078 length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if
10079 any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.  It is only when a
10080 leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters,
10081 some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a
10082 little anxious.
10083 
10084 "Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was
10085 found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern
10086 manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.
10087 He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,
10088 and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,
10089 was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of
10090 nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,
10091 unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently
10092 imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about
10093 the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only
10094 on account of his being a part owner in her.  So when they were
10095 working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small
10096 gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet
10097 continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any
10098 mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across
10099 the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
10100 scupper-holes.
10101 
10102 "Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this
10103 conventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person
10104 placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very
10105 significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway
10106 against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and
10107 bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize
10108 that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.  Be
10109 this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt
10110 was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing
10111 golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's
10112 snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him,
10113 gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son
10114 to Charlemagne's father.  But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule;
10115 yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.  He did not love Steelkilt,
10116 and Steelkilt knew it.
10117 
10118 "Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
10119 rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on
10120 with his gay banterings.
10121 
10122 "'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
10123 one of ye, and let's have a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!
10124 I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had
10125 best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,
10126 boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a
10127 gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and
10128 the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at
10129 the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here
10130 now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing
10131 the devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he's a simple old
10132 soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his
10133 property is invested in looking-glasses.  I wonder if he'd give a
10134 poor devil like me the model of his nose.'
10135 
10136 "'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,
10137 pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk.  'Thunder away at
10138 it!'
10139 
10140 'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,
10141 lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty
10142 fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that
10143 peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest
10144 tension of life's utmost energies.
10145 
10146 "Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman
10147 went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his
10148 face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from
10149 his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed
10150 Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated
10151 state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along
10152 the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the
10153 planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters
10154 consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.
10155 
10156 "Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of
10157 household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly
10158 attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case
10159 of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the
10160 inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in
10161 seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing
10162 their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the
10163 prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,
10164 it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into
10165 gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman
10166 of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of
10167 the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial
10168 business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the
10169 case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you
10170 may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.
10171 
10172 "But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost
10173 as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had
10174 spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
10175 understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman
10176 fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat
10177 still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's
10178 malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in
10179 him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
10180 instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and
10181 unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already
10182 ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really
10183 valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,
10184 gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.
10185 
10186 "Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
10187 exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that
10188 sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And
10189 then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three
10190 lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the
10191 pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied
10192 with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner
10193 unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the
10194 still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he
10195 had snatched from a cask near by.
10196 
10197 "Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,
10198 for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating
10199 Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow
10200 still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he
10201 remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed
10202 Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously
10203 commanding him to do his bidding.
10204 
10205 "Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
10206 followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
10207 his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had
10208 not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with
10209 his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
10210 was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round
10211 the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking
10212 him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the
10213 Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
10214 
10215 "'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to
10216 yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,
10217 where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an
10218 inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable
10219 maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;
10220 stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,
10221 Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing
10222 it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek
10223 he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been
10224 branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer
10225 touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was
10226 stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.
10227 
10228 "Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
10229 leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
10230 mastheads.  They were both Canallers.
10231 
10232 "'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro.  'We have seen many whale-ships in our
10233 harbours, but never heard of your Canallers.  Pardon: who and what are
10234 they?'
10235 
10236 "'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.
10237 You must have heard of it.'
10238 
10239 "'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and
10240 hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.'
10241 
10242 "'Aye?  Well then, Don, refill my cup.  Your chicha's very fine; and
10243 ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for
10244 such information may throw side-light upon my story.'
10245 
10246 "For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire
10247 breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities
10248 and most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps,
10249 and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by
10250 billiard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great
10251 forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade;
10252 by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery
10253 of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white
10254 chapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one
10255 continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life.
10256 There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where
10257 you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow,
10258 and the snug patronising lee of churches.  For by some curious
10259 fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that
10260 they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen,
10261 most abound in holiest vicinities.
10262 
10263 "'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into
10264 the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
10265 
10266 "'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes in
10267 Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian.  'Proceed, Senor.'
10268 
10269 "'A moment!  Pardon!' cried another of the company.  'In the name of
10270 all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we
10271 have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present
10272 Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.  Oh! do not bow
10273 and look surprised; you know the proverb all along this
10274 coast--"Corrupt as Lima."  It but bears out your saying, too;
10275 churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open--and
10276 "Corrupt as Lima."  So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city
10277 of the blessed evangelist, St. Mark!--St. Dominic, purge it!  Your
10278 cup!  Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.'
10279 
10280 "Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would
10281 make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
10282 he.  Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed,
10283 flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his
10284 red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny
10285 deck.  But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed.  The brigandish
10286 guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and
10287 gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.  A terror to the
10288 smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart
10289 visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.  Once a vagabond
10290 on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these
10291 Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it
10292 is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of
10293 violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor
10294 stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one.  In sum,
10295 gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically
10296 evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its
10297 most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except
10298 Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.  Nor does
10299 it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many
10300 thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the
10301 probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition
10302 between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly
10303 ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.
10304 
10305 "'I see!  I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his
10306 chicha upon his silvery ruffles.  'No need to travel!  The world's
10307 one Lima.  I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the
10308 generations were cold and holy as the hills.--But the story.'
10309 
10310 "I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay.
10311 Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior
10312 mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.  But
10313 sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed
10314 into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the
10315 forecastle.  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt,
10316 and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm's way, the
10317 valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon
10318 his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him
10319 along to the quarter-deck.  At intervals, he ran close up to the
10320 revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it
10321 with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.  But
10322 Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they
10323 succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing
10324 about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these
10325 sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
10326 
10327 "'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing
10328 them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.
10329 'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!'
10330 
10331 "Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
10332 defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
10333 understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the
10334 signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.  Fearing in
10335 his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little
10336 desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to
10337 their duty.
10338 
10339 "'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their
10340 ringleader.
10341 
10342 "'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty!  Do you want
10343 to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?  Turn to!' and
10344 he once more raised a pistol.
10345 
10346 "'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt.  'Aye, let her sink.  Not a man of
10347 us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.
10348 What say ye, men?' turning to his comrades.  A fierce cheer was their
10349 response.
10350 
10351 "The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his
10352 eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:--'It's
10353 not our fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away;
10354 it was boy's business; he might have known me before this; I told him
10355 not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here
10356 against his cursed jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the
10357 forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.
10358 Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don't be a fool;
10359 forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we're
10360 your men; but we won't be flogged.'
10361 
10362 "'Turn to!  I make no promises, turn to, I say!'
10363 
10364 "'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
10365 'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped
10366 for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
10367 discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's
10368 not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but
10369 we won't be flogged.'
10370 
10371 "'Turn to!' roared the Captain.
10372 
10373 "Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--'I tell you
10374 what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a
10375 shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us;
10376 but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's
10377 turn.'
10378 
10379 "'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there
10380 till ye're sick of it.  Down ye go.'
10381 
10382 "'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men.  Most of them were
10383 against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded
10384 him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears
10385 into a cave.
10386 
10387 "As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the
10388 Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over
10389 the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and
10390 loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock
10391 belonging to the companionway.
10392 
10393 Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down
10394 the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in
10395 number--leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
10396 remained neutral.
10397 
10398 "All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward
10399 and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway;
10400 at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after
10401 breaking through the bulkhead below.  But the hours of darkness
10402 passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling
10403 hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through
10404 the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.
10405 
10406 "At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
10407 summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused.  Water
10408 was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit
10409 were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and
10410 pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck.  Twice every
10411 day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a
10412 confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary
10413 summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the
10414 forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.  The fetid closeness
10415 of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of
10416 ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at
10417 discretion.  Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to
10418 the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his
10419 babbling and betake himself where he belonged.  On the fifth morning
10420 three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the
10421 desperate arms below that sought to restrain them.  Only three were
10422 left.
10423 
10424 "'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
10425 
10426 "'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.
10427 
10428 "'Oh certainly,' the Captain, and the key clicked.
10429 
10430 "It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of
10431 seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that
10432 had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place
10433 as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt
10434 proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with
10435 him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the
10436 garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic,
10437 heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the
10438 bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation
10439 possible, seize the ship.  For himself, he would do this, he said,
10440 whether they joined him or not.  That was the last night he should
10441 spend in that den.  But the scheme met with no opposition on the part
10442 of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any
10443 other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.  And what was
10444 more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the
10445 time to make the rush should come.  But to this their leader as
10446 fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly
10447 as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the
10448 matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but
10449 admit one man at a time.  And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these
10450 miscreants must come out.
10451 
10452 "Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
10453 separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same
10454 piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in
10455 order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to
10456 surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such
10457 conduct might merit.  But when Steelkilt made known his determination
10458 still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle
10459 chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;
10460 and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls
10461 to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords,
10462 and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at
10463 midnight.
10464 
10465 "Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he
10466 and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle.
10467 In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot,
10468 the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his
10469 perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man
10470 who had been fully ripe for murder.  But all these were collared, and
10471 dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were
10472 seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and
10473 there they hung till morning.  'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing
10474 to and fro before them, 'the vultures would not touch ye, ye
10475 villains!'
10476 
10477 "At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had
10478 rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the
10479 former that he had a good mind to flog them all round--thought, upon
10480 the whole, he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for
10481 the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go
10482 with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
10483 
10484 "'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men in the
10485 rigging--'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;' and,
10486 seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
10487 two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their
10488 heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
10489 
10490 "'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is
10491 still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give
10492 up.  Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say
10493 for himself.'
10494 
10495 "For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
10496 cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a
10497 sort of hiss, 'What I say is this--and mind it well--if you flog me,
10498 I murder you!'
10499 
10500 "'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'--and the Captain drew off
10501 with the rope to strike.
10502 
10503 "'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.
10504 
10505 "'But I must,'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
10506 
10507 "Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the
10508 Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the
10509 deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his
10510 rope, said, 'I won't do it--let him go--cut him down: d'ye hear?'
10511 
10512 But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
10513 man, with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate.
10514 Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning,
10515 hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had
10516 watched the whole scene.  Such was the state of his mouth, that he
10517 could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing
10518 and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the
10519 rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
10520 
10521 "'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.
10522 
10523 "'So I am, but take that.'  The mate was in the very act of striking,
10524 when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.  He paused: and then
10525 pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat,
10526 whatever that might have been.  The three men were then cut down, all
10527 hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the
10528 iron pumps clanged as before.
10529 
10530 "Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
10531 was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running
10532 up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the
10533 crew.  Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at
10534 their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for
10535 salvation.  Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.  On
10536 the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they
10537 had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders
10538 to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.
10539 But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all
10540 agreed to another thing--namely, not to sing out for whales, in case
10541 any should be discovered.  For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her
10542 other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her
10543 captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on
10544 the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate
10545 was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his
10546 bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
10547 
10548 "But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
10549 passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till
10550 all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the
10551 man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.  He was in
10552 Radney the chief mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to
10553 run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the
10554 rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain,
10555 upon resuming the head of his watch at night.  Upon this, and one or
10556 two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of
10557 his revenge.
10558 
10559 "During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
10560 bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
10561 the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.
10562 In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed.  There was a
10563 considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
10564 this was the sea.  Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his
10565 next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the
10566 morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed.  At
10567 his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very
10568 carefully in his watches below.
10569 
10570 "'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.
10571 
10572 "'What do you think? what does it look like?'
10573 
10574 "'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'
10575 
10576 'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length
10577 before him; 'but I think it will answer.  Shipmate, I haven't enough
10578 twine,--have you any?'
10579 
10580 "But there was none in the forecastle.
10581 
10582 "'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.
10583 
10584 "'You don't mean to go a begging to HIM!' said a sailor.
10585 
10586 "'Why not?  Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help
10587 himself in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he looked at
10588 him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock.  It
10589 was given him--neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the
10590 next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the
10591 pocket of the Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat
10592 into his hammock for a pillow.  Twenty-four hours after, his trick at
10593 the silent helm--nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave
10594 always ready dug to the seaman's hand--that fatal hour was then to
10595 come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was
10596 already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed
10597 in.
10598 
10599 "But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody
10600 deed he had planned.  Yet complete revenge he had, and without being
10601 the avenger.  For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to
10602 step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he
10603 would have done.
10604 
10605 "It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the
10606 second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid
10607 Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted
10608 out, 'There she rolls! there she rolls!'  Jesu, what a whale!  It was
10609 Moby Dick.
10610 
10611 "'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic!  Sir sailor, but do
10612 whales have christenings?  Whom call you Moby Dick?'
10613 
10614 "'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,
10615 Don;--but that would be too long a story.'
10616 
10617 "'How? how?' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
10618 
10619 "'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay!  I cannot rehearse that now.  Let me get
10620 more into the air, Sirs.'
10621 
10622 "'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend looks
10623 faint;--fill up his empty glass!'
10624 
10625 "No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen, so
10626 suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
10627 ship--forgetful of the compact among the crew--in the excitement of
10628 the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily
10629 lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it
10630 had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was
10631 now a phrensy.  'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from
10632 captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,
10633 were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the
10634 dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of
10635 the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun,
10636 shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.
10637 Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these
10638 events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
10639 The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it
10640 was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in
10641 the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.
10642 Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate's got the start;
10643 and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he
10644 strained at his oar.  After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast,
10645 and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.  He was always a
10646 furious man, it seems, in a boat.  And now his bandaged cry was, to
10647 beach him on the whale's topmost back.  Nothing loath, his bowsman
10648 hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two
10649 whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a
10650 sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.  That
10651 instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted,
10652 and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into
10653 the sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the
10654 spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly
10655 seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale
10656 rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his
10657 jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went
10658 down.
10659 
10660 "Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had
10661 slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
10662 looking on, he thought his own thoughts.  But a sudden, terrific,
10663 downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line.
10664 He cut it; and the whale was free.  But, at some distance, Moby Dick
10665 rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught
10666 in the teeth that had destroyed him.  All four boats gave chase
10667 again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
10668 
10669 "In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary
10670 place--where no civilized creature resided.  There, headed by the
10671 Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately
10672 deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a
10673 large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some
10674 other harbor.
10675 
10676 "The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain
10677 called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of
10678 heaving down the ship to stop the leak.  But to such unresting
10679 vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites
10680 necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard
10681 work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea,
10682 they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put
10683 off with them in so heavy a vessel.  After taking counsel with his
10684 officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded
10685 and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the
10686 poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their
10687 peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best
10688 whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred
10689 miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
10690 
10691 "On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which
10692 seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.  He steered away from
10693 it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of
10694 Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water.
10695 The captain presented a pistol.  With one foot on each prow of the
10696 yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that
10697 if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in
10698 bubbles and foam.
10699 
10700 "'What do you want of me?' cried the captain.
10701 
10702 "'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?' demanded
10703 Steelkilt; 'no lies.'
10704 
10705 "'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.'
10706 
10707 "'Very good.  Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.'  With that
10708 he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
10709 stood face to face with the captain.
10710 
10711 "'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head.  Now, repeat after me.
10712 As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
10713 island, and remain there six days.  If I do not, may lightning strike
10714 me!'
10715 
10716 "'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman.  'Adios, Senor!' and
10717 leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
10718 
10719 "Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
10720 roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due
10721 time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.  There, luck
10722 befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were
10723 providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the
10724 sailor headed.  They embarked; and so for ever got the start of
10725 their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal
10726 retribution.
10727 
10728 "Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
10729 and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
10730 Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.  Chartering a small
10731 native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
10732 right there, again resumed his cruisings.
10733 
10734 "Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
10735 Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses
10736 to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
10737 destroyed him.
10738 
10739 "'Are you through?' said Don Sebastian, quietly.
10740 
10741 "'I am, Don.'
10742 
10743 "'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
10744 this your story is in substance really true?  It is so passing
10745 wonderful!  Did you get it from an unquestionable source?  Bear with
10746 me if I seem to press.'
10747 
10748 "'Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don
10749 Sebastian's suit,' cried the company, with exceeding interest.
10750 
10751 "'Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,
10752 gentlemen?'
10753 
10754 "'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who
10755 will quickly procure one for me.  I go for it; but are you well
10756 advised? this may grow too serious.'
10757 
10758 "'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'
10759 
10760 "'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the
10761 company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the
10762 archiepiscopacy.  Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.  I see
10763 no need of this.'
10764 
10765 "'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg
10766 that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized
10767 Evangelists you can.'
10768 
10769 
10770 'This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,' said Don
10771 Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
10772 
10773 "'Let me remove my hat.  Now, venerable priest, further into the
10774 light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
10775 
10776 "'So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye,
10777 gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true.  I know it to
10778 be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew;
10779 I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.'"
10780 
10781 
10782 
10783 CHAPTER 55
10784 
10785 Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
10786 
10787 
10788 I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
10789 something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to
10790 the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is
10791 moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon
10792 there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to
10793 those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the
10794 present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is
10795 time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures
10796 of the whale all wrong.
10797 
10798 It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions
10799 will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian
10800 sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times
10801 when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,
10802 and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in
10803 scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.
10804 George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license
10805 prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in
10806 many scientific presentations of him.
10807 
10808 Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting
10809 to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of
10810 Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost
10811 endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and
10812 pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages
10813 before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in
10814 some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there
10815 shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate
10816 department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the
10817 form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though
10818 this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the
10819 tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It
10820 looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms
10821 of the true whale's majestic flukes.
10822 
10823 But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
10824 painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the
10825 antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing
10826 Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the
10827 model of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in
10828 painting the same scene in his own "Perseus Descending," make out one
10829 whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster
10830 undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has
10831 a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into
10832 which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate
10833 leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the
10834 Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as
10835 depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.
10836 What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding
10837 like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped
10838 and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and
10839 new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,
10840 imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though
10841 universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this
10842 book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended
10843 when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old
10844 Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the
10845 Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a
10846 comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
10847 species of the Leviathan.
10848 
10849 In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
10850 will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all
10851 manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and
10852 Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the
10853 title-page of the original edition of the "Advancement of Learning"
10854 you will find some curious whales.
10855 
10856 But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at
10857 those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific
10858 delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of
10859 voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book
10860 of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in
10861 the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master."
10862 In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are
10863 represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over
10864 their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made
10865 of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.
10866 
10867 Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
10868 Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled "A Voyage round
10869 Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the
10870 Spermaceti Whale Fisheries."  In this book is an outline purporting
10871 to be a "Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale
10872 from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on
10873 deck."  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for
10874 the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let
10875 me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the
10876 accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye
10877 of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant
10878 captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
10879 
10880 Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for
10881 the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness
10882 of mistake.  Look at that popular work "Goldsmith's Animated Nature."
10883 In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an
10884 alleged "whale" and a "narwhale."  I do not wish to seem inelegant,
10885 but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as
10886 for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in
10887 this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine
10888 upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.
10889 
10890 Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great
10891 naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
10892 several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All
10893 these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or
10894 Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a
10895 long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have
10896 its counterpart in nature.
10897 
10898 But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
10899 reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
10900 Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which
10901 he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing
10902 that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your
10903 summary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm
10904 Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had
10905 the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he
10906 derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his
10907 scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his
10908 authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort
10909 of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and
10910 saucers inform us.
10911 
10912 As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the
10913 shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?  They are generally
10914 Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
10915 breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full
10916 of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
10917 paint.
10918 
10919 But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
10920 surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings
10921 have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as
10922 correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would
10923 correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride
10924 of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their
10925 full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated
10926 himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and
10927 significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and
10928 afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched
10929 line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally
10930 impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to
10931 preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of
10932 the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking
10933 whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of
10934 one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is
10935 then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that
10936 his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.
10937 
10938 But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
10939 whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at
10940 all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,
10941 that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.
10942 Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the
10943 library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a
10944 burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other
10945 leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be
10946 inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the
10947 great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same
10948 relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does
10949 to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity
10950 is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will
10951 be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the
10952 side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the
10953 human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular
10954 bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all
10955 these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
10956 fingers in an artificial covering.  "However recklessly the whale may
10957 sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be
10958 truly said to handle us without mittens."
10959 
10960 For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must
10961 needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the
10962 world which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait
10963 may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with
10964 any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly
10965 way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And
10966 the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his
10967 living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you
10968 run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.
10969 Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your
10970 curiosity touching this Leviathan.
10971 
10972 
10973 
10974 CHAPTER 56
10975 
10976 Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of
10977 Whaling Scenes.
10978 
10979 
10980 In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
10981 tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
10982 which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
10983 especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc.  But I
10984 pass that matter by.
10985 
10986 I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
10987 Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.  In the
10988 previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.  Huggins's
10989 is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale's is the best.
10990 All Beale's drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle
10991 figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping
10992 his second chapter.  His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales,
10993 though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some
10994 parlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect.
10995 Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.  Ross Browne are pretty
10996 correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved.  That is not
10997 his fault though.
10998 
10999 Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but
11000 they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression.
11001 He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad
11002 deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well
11003 done, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living
11004 whale as seen by his living hunters.
11005 
11006 But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
11007 not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
11008 be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,
11009 and taken from paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, they
11010 represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale.  In the first
11011 engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,
11012 just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and
11013 bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the
11014 stoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is
11015 drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that
11016 prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an
11017 oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,
11018 and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the
11019 whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub
11020 floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons
11021 obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered
11022 about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the
11023 black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.
11024 Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this
11025 whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw
11026 so good a one.
11027 
11028 In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
11029 the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his
11030 black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
11031 Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so
11032 that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there
11033 must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls
11034 are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
11035 maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent
11036 back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing
11037 through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,
11038 and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught
11039 nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is
11040 all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is
11041 the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of
11042 the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
11043 fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole
11044 inserted into his spout-hole.
11045 
11046 Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not.  But my life for it
11047 he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
11048 marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.  The French are
11049 the lads for painting action.  Go and gaze upon all the paintings of
11050 Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and
11051 breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at
11052 Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the
11053 consecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash
11054 of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors
11055 dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs?  Not wholly unworthy of a
11056 place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.
11057 
11058 The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
11059 things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and
11060 engravings they have of their whaling scenes.  With not one tenth of
11061 England's experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of
11062 that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations
11063 with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real
11064 spirit of the whale hunt.  For the most part, the English and
11065 American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the
11066 mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the
11067 whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is
11068 about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.  Even
11069 Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff
11070 full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate
11071 miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of
11072 classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels;
11073 and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the
11074 inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified
11075 Arctic snow crystals.  I mean no disparagement to the excellent
11076 voyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it
11077 was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a
11078 sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.
11079 
11080 In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two
11081 other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes
11082 himself "H.  Durand."  One of them, though not precisely adapted to
11083 our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts.
11084 It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French
11085 whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on
11086 board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the
11087 palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless
11088 air.  The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its
11089 presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of
11090 oriental repose.  The other engraving is quite a different affair:
11091 the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the
11092 Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the
11093 act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a
11094 boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about
11095 giving chase to whales in the distance.  The harpoons and lances lie
11096 levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its
11097 hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
11098 half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.  From the ship,
11099 the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the
11100 smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,
11101 rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the
11102 activity of the excited seamen.

11106 CHAPTER 57
11107 
11108 Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in
11109 Mountains; in Stars.
11110 
11111 
11112 On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen
11113 a crippled beggar (or KEDGER, as the sailors say) holding a painted
11114 board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his
11115 leg.  There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
11116 (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity)
11117 is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.  Any time these
11118 ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and
11119 exhibited that stump to an incredulous world.  But the time of his
11120 justification has now come.  His three whales are as good whales as
11121 were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as
11122 unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings.
11123 But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech
11124 does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully
11125 contemplating his own amputation.
11126 
11127 Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and
11128 Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
11129 whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm
11130 Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone,
11131 and other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the
11132 numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of
11133 the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure.  Some of them
11134 have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially
11135 intended for the skrimshandering business.  But, in general, they
11136 toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent
11137 tool of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in
11138 the way of a mariner's fancy.
11139 
11140 Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a
11141 man to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called
11142 savagery.  Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois.
11143 I myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the
11144 Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.
11145 
11146 Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his
11147 domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry.  An ancient
11148 Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and
11149 elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as
11150 a Latin lexicon.  For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a
11151 shark's tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been
11152 achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.
11153 
11154 As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage.  With
11155 the same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark's tooth,
11156 of his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone
11157 sculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its
11158 maziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles's shield; and full
11159 of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old
11160 Dutch savage, Albert Durer.
11161 
11162 Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs
11163 of the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
11164 forecastles of American whalers.  Some of them are done with much
11165 accuracy.
11166 
11167 At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales
11168 hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door.  When the porter
11169 is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best.  But these knocking
11170 whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays.  On the spires of
11171 some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed
11172 there for weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that
11173 are to all intents and purposes so labelled with "HANDS OFF!" you
11174 cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.
11175 
11176 In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
11177 cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the
11178 plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of
11179 the Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks
11180 against them in a surf of green surges.
11181 
11182 Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
11183 continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from
11184 some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the
11185 profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.  But you must
11186 be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but
11187 if you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and
11188 take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first
11189 stand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills,
11190 that your precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious
11191 re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita,
11192 though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera
11193 chronicled them.
11194 
11195 Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace
11196 out great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them;
11197 as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw
11198 armies locked in battle among the clouds.  Thus at the North have I
11199 chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the
11200 bright points that first defined him to me.  And beneath the
11201 effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined
11202 the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of
11203 Hydrus and the Flying Fish.
11204 
11205 With a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons
11206 for spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies,
11207 to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents
11208 really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!
11209 
11210 
11211 
11212 CHAPTER 58
11213 
11214 Brit.
11215 
11216 
11217 Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast
11218 meadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right
11219 Whale largely feeds.  For leagues and leagues it undulated round us,
11220 so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and
11221 golden wheat.
11222 
11223 On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure
11224 from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws
11225 sluggishly swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing
11226 fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that
11227 manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip.
11228 
11229 As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
11230 their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so
11231 these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and
11232 leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
11233 
11234 
11235 *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the "Brazil Banks" does
11236 not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
11237 being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
11238 meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
11239 floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
11240 
11241 
11242 But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
11243 all reminded one of mowers.  Seen from the mast-heads, especially
11244 when they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black
11245 forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else.
11246 And as in the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a
11247 distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants
11248 without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare, blackened
11249 elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first
11250 time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.  And even
11251 when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very
11252 hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can
11253 possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that
11254 lives in a dog or a horse.
11255 
11256 Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
11257 deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore.  For
11258 though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the
11259 land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general
11260 view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties,
11261 where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in
11262 disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog?  The
11263 accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear
11264 comparative analogy to him.
11265 
11266 But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the
11267 seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
11268 repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra
11269 incognita, so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to
11270 discover his one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the
11271 most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and
11272 indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who
11273 have gone upon the waters; though but a moment's consideration will
11274 teach, that however baby man may brag of his science and skill, and
11275 however much, in a flattering future, that science and skill may
11276 augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea
11277 will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
11278 frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of
11279 these very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness
11280 of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.
11281 
11282 The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
11283 vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a
11284 widow.  That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the
11285 wrecked ships of last year.  Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is
11286 not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
11287 
11288 Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
11289 miracle upon the other?  Preternatural terrors rested upon the
11290 Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground
11291 opened and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever
11292 sets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships
11293 and crews.
11294 
11295 But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but
11296 it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host
11297 who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself
11298 hath spawned.  Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle
11299 overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales
11300 against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split
11301 wrecks of ships.  No mercy, no power but its own controls it.
11302 Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider,
11303 the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
11304 
11305 Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
11306 glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
11307 hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure.  Consider also the
11308 devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless
11309 tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks.
11310 Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose
11311 creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the
11312 world began.
11313 
11314 Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most
11315 docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you
11316 not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?  For as this
11317 appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man
11318 there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed
11319 by all the horrors of the half known life.  God keep thee!  Push not
11320 off from that isle, thou canst never return!
11321 
11322 
11323 CHAPTER 59
11324 
11325 Squid.
11326 
11327 
11328 Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on
11329 her way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air
11330 impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three
11331 tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three
11332 mild palms on a plain.  And still, at wide intervals in the silvery
11333 night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.
11334 
11335 But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost
11336 preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any
11337 stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed
11338 a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the
11339 slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on; in this
11340 profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by
11341 Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
11342 
11343 In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher
11344 and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed
11345 before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills.  Thus
11346 glistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank.  Then once
11347 more arose, and silently gleamed.  It seemed not a whale; and yet is
11348 this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo.  Again the phantom went down, but on
11349 re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every
11350 man from his nod, the negro yelled out--"There! there again! there
11351 she breaches! right ahead!  The White Whale, the White Whale!"
11352 
11353 Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time
11354 the bees rush to the boughs.  Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab
11355 stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in
11356 readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance
11357 in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm
11358 of Daggoo.
11359 
11360 Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
11361 gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect
11362 the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the
11363 particular whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his
11364 eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner
11365 did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick
11366 intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.
11367 
11368 The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance, and all
11369 swiftly pulling towards their prey.  Soon it went down, and while,
11370 with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the
11371 same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.  Almost forgetting
11372 for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most
11373 wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to
11374 mankind.  A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a
11375 glancing cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long
11376 arms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest
11377 of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within
11378 reach.  No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable
11379 token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the
11380 billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
11381 
11382 As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck
11383 still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild
11384 voice exclaimed--"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him,
11385 than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!"
11386 
11387 "What was it, Sir?" said Flask.
11388 
11389 "The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
11390 and returned to their ports to tell of it."
11391 
11392 But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the
11393 vessel; the rest as silently following.
11394 
11395 Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
11396 with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
11397 being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it
11398 with portentousness.  So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all
11399 of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet
11400 very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its
11401 true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to
11402 the sperm whale his only food.  For though other species of whales
11403 find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of
11404 feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones
11405 below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell
11406 of what, precisely, that food consists.  At times, when closely
11407 pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms
11408 of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty
11409 feet in length.  They fancy that the monster to which these arms
11410 belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that
11411 the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in
11412 order to attack and tear it.
11413 
11414 There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
11415 Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.  The manner in
11416 which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking,
11417 with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two
11418 correspond.  But much abatement is necessary with respect to the
11419 incredible bulk he assigns it.
11420 
11421 By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
11422 creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
11423 cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would
11424 seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.
11425 
11426 
11427 
11428 CHAPTER 60
11429 
11430 The Line.
11431 
11432 
11433 With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well
11434 as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere
11435 presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible
11436 whale-line.
11437 
11438 The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,
11439 slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of
11440 ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp
11441 more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more
11442 convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the
11443 ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close
11444 coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are
11445 beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope's
11446 durability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and
11447 gloss.
11448 
11449 Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
11450 entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though
11451 not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and
11452 elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things),
11453 is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.  Hemp is a
11454 dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a
11455 golden-haired Circassian to behold.
11456 
11457 The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness.  At first
11458 sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.  By
11459 experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one
11460 hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain
11461 nearly equal to three tons.  In length, the common sperm whale-line
11462 measures something over two hundred fathoms.  Towards the stern of
11463 the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the
11464 worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,
11465 cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of
11466 concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or
11467 minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese.  As the least
11468 tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
11469 somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is
11470 used in stowing the line in its tub.  Some harpooneers will consume
11471 almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high
11472 aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub,
11473 so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and
11474 twists.
11475 
11476 In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
11477 being continuously coiled in both tubs.  There is some advantage in
11478 this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily
11479 into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American
11480 tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes
11481 a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch
11482 in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice,
11483 which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very
11484 much of a concentrated one.  When the painted canvas cover is clapped
11485 on the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off
11486 with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.
11487 
11488 Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
11489 eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
11490 tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
11491 This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.
11492 First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional
11493 line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound
11494 so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally
11495 attached to the harpoon.  In these instances, the whale of course is
11496 shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the
11497 other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its
11498 consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common
11499 safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached
11500 to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end
11501 almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not
11502 stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down
11503 after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no
11504 town-crier would ever find her again.
11505 
11506 Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
11507 taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is
11508 again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting
11509 crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs
11510 against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as
11511 they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks
11512 or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden
11513 pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping
11514 out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and
11515 is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms
11516 (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues
11517 its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then
11518 attached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected
11519 with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes
11520 through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.
11521 
11522 Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
11523 twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.  All the
11524 oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the
11525 timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the
11526 deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.  Nor can any son
11527 of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen
11528 intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him
11529 that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these
11530 horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot
11531 be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in
11532 his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.  Yet habit--strange
11533 thing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry
11534 mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over
11535 your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of
11536 the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six
11537 burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew
11538 pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you
11539 may say.
11540 
11541 Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
11542 those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually
11543 chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by
11544 the line, and lost.  For, when the line is darting out, to be seated
11545 then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold
11546 whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and
11547 shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.  It is worse; for you cannot sit
11548 motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking
11549 like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the
11550 slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
11551 simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
11552 Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
11553 never pierce you out.
11554 
11555 Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
11556 prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
11557 for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm;
11558 and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the
11559 fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose
11560 of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before
11561 being brought into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of
11562 true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair.  But why
11563 say more?  All men live enveloped in whale-lines.  All are born with
11564 halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,
11565 sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle,
11566 ever-present perils of life.  And if you be a philosopher, though
11567 seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more
11568 of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker,
11569 and not a harpoon, by your side.
11570 
11571 
11572 
11573 CHAPTER 61
11574 
11575 Stubb Kills a Whale.
11576 
11577 
11578 If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents,
11579 to Queequeg it was quite a different object.
11580 
11581 "When you see him 'quid," said the savage, honing his harpoon in the
11582 bow of his hoisted boat, "then you quick see him 'parm whale."
11583 
11584 The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing
11585 special to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the
11586 spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea.  For this part of the
11587 Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen
11588 call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of
11589 porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of
11590 more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the
11591 in-shore ground off Peru.
11592 
11593 It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
11594 leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
11595 in what seemed an enchanted air.  No resolution could withstand it;
11596 in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went
11597 out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum
11598 will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.
11599 
11600 Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the
11601 seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy.  So
11602 that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for
11603 every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the
11604 slumbering helmsman.  The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;
11605 and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the
11606 sun over all.
11607 
11608 Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices
11609 my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency
11610 preserved me; with a shock I came back to life.  And lo! close under
11611 our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in
11612 the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy
11613 back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays like a
11614 mirror.  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and
11615 anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a
11616 portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon.  But that pipe,
11617 poor whale, was thy last.  As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the
11618 sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into
11619 wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the
11620 vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth
11621 the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
11622 the sparkling brine into the air.
11623 
11624 "Clear away the boats!  Luff!" cried Ahab.  And obeying his own
11625 order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the
11626 spokes.
11627 
11628 The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
11629 ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
11630 leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few
11631 ripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be
11632 alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man
11633 must speak but in whispers.  So seated like Ontario Indians on the
11634 gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the
11635 calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as
11636 we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail
11637 forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower
11638 swallowed up.
11639 
11640 "There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed
11641 by Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a
11642 respite was granted.  After the full interval of his sounding had
11643 elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the
11644 smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb
11645 counted upon the honour of the capture.  It was obvious, now, that the
11646 whale had at length become aware of his pursuers.  All silence of
11647 cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.  Paddles were dropped,
11648 and oars came loudly into play.  And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb
11649 cheered on his crew to the assault.
11650 
11651 Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish.  All alive to his
11652 jeopardy, he was going "head out"; that part obliquely projecting
11653 from the mad yeast which he brewed.*
11654 
11655 
11656 *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
11657 the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists.
11658 Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant
11659 part about him.  So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and
11660 invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.  Besides, such is
11661 the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the
11662 tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely
11663 elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from
11664 a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York
11665 pilot-boat.
11666 
11667 
11668 "Start her, start her, my men!  Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty
11669 of time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all,"
11670 cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.  "Start her, now;
11671 give 'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my
11672 boy--start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the
11673 word--easy, easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils,
11674 and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,
11675 boys--that's all.  Start her!"
11676 
11677 "Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some
11678 old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
11679 involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
11680 which the eager Indian gave.
11681 
11682 But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.
11683 "Kee-hee!  Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards
11684 on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.
11685 
11686 "Ka-la!  Koo-loo!" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
11687 mouthful of Grenadier's steak.  And thus with oars and yells the
11688 keels cut the sea.  Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the
11689 van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the
11690 smoke from his mouth.  Like desperadoes they tugged and they
11691 strained, till the welcome cry was heard--"Stand up, Tashtego!--give
11692 it to him!"  The harpoon was hurled.  "Stern all!"  The oarsmen
11693 backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along
11694 every one of their wrists.  It was the magical line.  An instant
11695 before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round
11696 the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a
11697 hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes
11698 from his pipe.  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so
11699 also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through
11700 and through both of Stubb's hands, from which the hand-cloths, or
11701 squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had
11702 accidentally dropped.  It was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged
11703 sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it
11704 out of your clutch.
11705 
11706 "Wet the line! wet the line!" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him
11707 seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
11708 it.*  More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
11709 The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
11710 Stubb and Tashtego here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering
11711 business truly in that rocking commotion.
11712 
11713 
11714 *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
11715 stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
11716 running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
11717 bailer, is set apart for that purpose.  Your hat, however, is the
11718 most convenient.
11719 
11720 
11721 From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
11722 of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
11723 would have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water,
11724 the other the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing
11725 elements at once.  A continual cascade played at the bows; a
11726 ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion
11727 from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking
11728 craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they
11729 rushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent
11730 being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the
11731 steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his
11732 centre of gravity.  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as
11733 they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened
11734 his flight.
11735 
11736 "Haul in--haul in!" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
11737 towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while
11738 yet the boat was being towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,
11739 Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart
11740 after dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat
11741 alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow,
11742 and then ranging up for another fling.
11743 
11744 The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks
11745 down a hill.  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,
11746 which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.  The
11747 slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back
11748 its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other
11749 like red men.  And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was
11750 agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff
11751 after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,
11752 hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb
11753 straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the
11754 gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.
11755 
11756 "Pull up--pull up!" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
11757 relaxed in his wrath.  "Pull up!--close to!" and the boat ranged
11758 along the fish's flank.  When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly
11759 churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,
11760 carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel
11761 after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which
11762 he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold
11763 watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.  And now it is
11764 struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing
11765 called his "flurry," the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,
11766 overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the
11767 imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to
11768 struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the
11769 day.
11770 
11771 And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into
11772 view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and
11773 contracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized
11774 respirations.  At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it
11775 had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and
11776 falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into
11777 the sea.  His heart had burst!
11778 
11779 "He's dead, Mr. Stubb," said Daggoo.
11780 
11781 "Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
11782 Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,
11783 stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
11784 
11785 
11786 
11787 CHAPTER 62
11788 
11789 The Dart.
11790 
11791 
11792 A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
11793 
11794 According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat
11795 pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as
11796 temporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the
11797 foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar.  Now it needs a
11798 strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for
11799 often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be
11800 flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.  But however
11801 prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to
11802 pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to
11803 set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by
11804 incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;
11805 and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass, while
11806 all the other muscles are strained and half started--what that is
11807 none know but those who have tried it.  For one, I cannot bawl very
11808 heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time.  In this
11809 straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at
11810 once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--"Stand up, and
11811 give it to him!"  He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round
11812 on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with
11813 what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into
11814 the whale.  No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body,
11815 that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful;
11816 no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and
11817 disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
11818 blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are
11819 absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
11820 owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer
11821 that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how
11822 can you expect to find it there when most wanted!
11823 
11824 Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical
11825 instant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and
11826 harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent
11827 jeopardy of themselves and every one else.  It is then they change
11828 places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft,
11829 takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.
11830 
11831 Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
11832 foolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay in the bows from
11833 first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no
11834 rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances
11835 obvious to any fisherman.  I know that this would sometimes involve a
11836 slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various
11837 whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
11838 majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so
11839 much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the
11840 harpooneer that has caused them.
11841 
11842 To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of
11843 this world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not
11844 from out of toil.
11845 
11846 
11847 
11848 CHAPTER 63
11849 
11850 The Crotch.
11851 
11852 
11853 Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.  So, in
11854 productive subjects, grow the chapters.
11855 
11856 The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent
11857 mention.  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in
11858 length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale
11859 near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden
11860 extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly
11861 projects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to
11862 its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a
11863 backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.  It is customary to have
11864 two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first
11865 and second irons.
11866 
11867 But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
11868 the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
11869 instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the
11870 coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.
11871 It is a doubling of the chances.  But it very often happens that
11872 owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale
11873 upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the
11874 harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the
11875 second iron into him.  Nevertheless, as the second iron is already
11876 connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon
11877 must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,
11878 somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve
11879 all hands.  Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;
11880 the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making
11881 this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this
11882 critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal
11883 casualties.
11884 
11885 Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
11886 overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
11887 skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the
11888 lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all
11889 directions.  Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until
11890 the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.
11891 
11892 Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
11893 one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
11894 qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
11895 such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
11896 simultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course, each boat is
11897 supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the
11898 first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.  All these
11899 particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to
11900 elucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in
11901 scenes hereafter to be painted.
11902 
11903 
11904 
11905 CHAPTER 64
11906 
11907 Stubb's Supper.
11908 
11909 
11910 Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship.  It was a
11911 calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
11912 business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen
11913 men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and
11914 fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish
11915 corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at
11916 long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the
11917 enormousness of the mass we moved.  For, upon the great canal of
11918 Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on
11919 the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile
11920 an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if
11921 laden with pig-lead in bulk.
11922 
11923 Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's
11924 main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
11925 dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.  Vacantly
11926 eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
11927 securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,
11928 went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until
11929 morning.
11930 
11931 Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
11932 evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the
11933 creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
11934 despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
11935 reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a
11936 thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not
11937 one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.  Very soon you would
11938 have thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks, that all hands
11939 were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being
11940 dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.
11941 But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is
11942 to be moored.  Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the
11943 bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's
11944 and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars
11945 and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together
11946 like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains
11947 standing.*
11948 
11949 
11950 *A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most
11951 reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored
11952 alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density
11953 that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the
11954 side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low
11955 beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from
11956 the boat, in order to put the chain round it.  But this difficulty is
11957 ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden
11958 float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other
11959 end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is
11960 made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having
11961 girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and
11962 being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the
11963 smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad
11964 flukes or lobes.
11965 
11966 
11967 If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be
11968 known on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,
11969 betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.  Such an
11970 unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official
11971 superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of
11972 affairs.  One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,
11973 was soon made strangely manifest.  Stubb was a high liver; he was
11974 somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his
11975 palate.
11976 
11977 "A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and
11978 cut me one from his small!"
11979 
11980 Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a
11981 general thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the
11982 enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before
11983 realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then you find some
11984 of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular
11985 part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering
11986 extremity of the body.
11987 
11988 About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
11989 lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti
11990 supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.  Nor
11991 was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.  Mingling
11992 their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of
11993 sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its
11994 fatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled
11995 by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few
11996 inches of the sleepers' hearts.  Peering over the side you could just
11997 see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black
11998 waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge
11999 globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.  This
12000 particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.  How at such
12001 an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such
12002 symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all
12003 things.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened
12004 to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.
12005 
12006 Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,
12007 sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like
12008 hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to
12009 bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while
12010 the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving
12011 each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,
12012 the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely
12013 carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you
12014 to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much
12015 the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough
12016 for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders
12017 of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting
12018 alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or
12019 a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like
12020 instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and
12021 occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most
12022 hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when
12023 you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more
12024 jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a
12025 whaleship at sea.  If you have never seen that sight, then suspend
12026 your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the
12027 expediency of conciliating the devil.
12028 
12029 But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
12030 going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of
12031 his own epicurean lips.
12032 
12033 "Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?" he cried at length, widening
12034 his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his
12035 supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if
12036 stabbing with his lance; "cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!"
12037 
12038 The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
12039 roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
12040 shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was
12041 something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well
12042 scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,
12043 came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,
12044 which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops;
12045 this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of
12046 command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's
12047 sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and resting on
12048 his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at
12049 the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best
12050 ear into play.
12051 
12052 "Cook," said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
12053 mouth, "don't you think this steak is rather overdone?  You've been
12054 beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender.  Don't I always
12055 say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough?  There are those
12056 sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and
12057 rare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!  Cook, go and talk to 'em;
12058 tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in
12059 moderation, but they must keep quiet.  Blast me, if I can hear my own
12060 voice.  Away, cook, and deliver my message.  Here, take this
12061 lantern," snatching one from his sideboard; "now then, go and preach
12062 to 'em!"
12063 
12064 Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the
12065 deck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low
12066 over the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the
12067 other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the
12068 side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb,
12069 softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.
12070 
12071 "Fellow-critters: I'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
12072 noise dare.  You hear?  Stop dat dam smackin' ob de lips!  Massa
12073 Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but
12074 by Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!"
12075 
12076 "Cook," here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden
12077 slap on the shoulder,--"Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn't swear
12078 that way when you're preaching.  That's no way to convert sinners,
12079 cook!"
12080 
12081 "Who dat?  Den preach to him yourself," sullenly turning to go.
12082 
12083 "No, cook; go on, go on."
12084 
12085 "Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:"-
12086 
12087 "Right!" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, "coax 'em to it; try that,"
12088 and Fleece continued.
12089 
12090 "Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
12091 fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin' ob de
12092 tail!  How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin'
12093 and bitin' dare?"
12094 
12095 "Cook," cried Stubb, collaring him, "I won't have that swearing.
12096 Talk to 'em gentlemanly."
12097 
12098 Once more the sermon proceeded.
12099 
12100 "Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don't blame ye so much for;
12101 dat is natur, and can't be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,
12102 dat is de pint.  You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in
12103 you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing more dan de shark
12104 well goberned.  Now, look here, bred'ren, just try wonst to be cibil,
12105 a helping yourselbs from dat whale.  Don't be tearin' de blubber out
12106 your neighbour's mout, I say.  Is not one shark dood right as toder
12107 to dat whale?  And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale;
12108 dat whale belong to some one else.  I know some o' you has berry brig
12109 mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de
12110 small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid,
12111 but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get
12112 into de scrouge to help demselves."
12113 
12114 "Well done, old Fleece!" cried Stubb, "that's Christianity; go on."
12115 
12116 "No use goin' on; de dam willains will keep a scougin' and slappin'
12117 each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don't hear one word; no use a-preaching
12118 to such dam g'uttons as you call 'em, till dare bellies is full, and
12119 dare bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get 'em full, dey wont
12120 hear you den; for den dey sink in the sea, go fast to sleep on de
12121 coral, and can't hear noting at all, no more, for eber and eber."
12122 
12123 "Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the
12124 benediction, Fleece, and I'll away to my supper."
12125 
12126 Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
12127 shrill voice, and cried--
12128 
12129 "Cussed fellow-critters!  Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;
12130 fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust--and den die."
12131 
12132 "Now, cook," said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; "stand
12133 just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay
12134 particular attention."
12135 
12136 "All 'dention," said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in
12137 the desired position.
12138 
12139 "Well," said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; "I shall now go
12140 back to the subject of this steak.  In the first place, how old are
12141 you, cook?"
12142 
12143 "What dat do wid de 'teak," said the old black, testily.
12144 
12145 "Silence!  How old are you, cook?"
12146 
12147 "'Bout ninety, dey say," he gloomily muttered.
12148 
12149 "And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
12150 and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak?" rapidly bolting
12151 another mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a
12152 continuation of the question.  "Where were you born, cook?"
12153 
12154 "'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke."
12155 
12156 "Born in a ferry-boat!  That's queer, too.  But I want to know what
12157 country you were born in, cook!"
12158 
12159 "Didn't I say de Roanoke country?" he cried sharply.
12160 
12161 "No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.
12162 You must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a
12163 whale-steak yet."
12164 
12165 "Bress my soul, if I cook noder one," he growled, angrily, turning
12166 round to depart.
12167 
12168 "Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit
12169 of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it
12170 should be?  Take it, I say"--holding the tongs towards him--"take it,
12171 and taste it."
12172 
12173 Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old
12174 negro muttered, "Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy."
12175 
12176 "Cook," said Stubb, squaring himself once more; "do you belong to the
12177 church?"
12178 
12179 "Passed one once in Cape-Down," said the old man sullenly.
12180 
12181 "And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,
12182 where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as
12183 his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook!  And yet you come here,
12184 and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?" said Stubb.
12185 "Where do you expect to go to, cook?"
12186 
12187 "Go to bed berry soon," he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
12188 
12189 "Avast! heave to!  I mean when you die, cook.  It's an awful
12190 question.  Now what's your answer?"
12191 
12192 "When dis old brack man dies," said the negro slowly, changing his
12193 whole air and demeanor, "he hisself won't go nowhere; but some
12194 bressed angel will come and fetch him."
12195 
12196 "Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?  And
12197 fetch him where?"
12198 
12199 "Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
12200 keeping it there very solemnly.
12201 
12202 "So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when
12203 you are dead?  But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it
12204 gets?  Main-top, eh?"
12205 
12206 "Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the sulks.
12207 
12208 "You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where
12209 your tongs are pointing.  But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven
12210 by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you
12211 don't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.
12212 It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go.  But
12213 none of us are in heaven yet.  Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my
12214 orders.  Do ye hear?  Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other
12215 a'top of your heart, when I'm giving my orders, cook.  What! that
12216 your heart, there?--that's your gizzard!  Aloft! aloft!--that's
12217 it--now you have it.  Hold it there now, and pay attention."
12218 
12219 "All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as
12220 desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears
12221 in front at one and the same time.
12222 
12223 "Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
12224 that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
12225 don't you?  Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak
12226 for my private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so
12227 as not to spoil it by overdoing.  Hold the steak in one hand, and
12228 show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear?
12229 And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure
12230 you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle.
12231 As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.  There, now ye
12232 may go."
12233 
12234 But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
12235 
12236 "Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
12237 D'ye hear? away you sail, then.--Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
12238 go.--Avast heaving again!  Whale-balls for breakfast--don't forget."
12239 
12240 "Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat whale.  I'm bressed
12241 if he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself," muttered the old
12242 man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his
12243 hammock.
12244 
12245 
12246 
12247 CHAPTER 65
12248 
12249 The Whale as a Dish.
12250 
12251 
12252 That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp,
12253 and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems
12254 so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the
12255 history and philosophy of it.
12256 
12257 It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
12258 Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
12259 prices there.  Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of
12260 the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce
12261 to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a
12262 species of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine
12263 eating.  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard
12264 balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for
12265 turtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very
12266 fond of them.  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.
12267 
12268 The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
12269 hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
12270 when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
12271 long, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men
12272 like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are
12273 not so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have
12274 rare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their
12275 most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as
12276 being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that
12277 certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland
12278 by a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months
12279 on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after
12280 trying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are
12281 called "fritters"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown
12282 and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'
12283 dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.  They have such an eatable look
12284 that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.
12285 
12286 But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
12287 exceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to
12288 be delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating
12289 as the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a
12290 solid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and
12291 creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a
12292 cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply
12293 a substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method
12294 of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.
12295 In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the
12296 seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them
12297 fry there awhile.  Many a good supper have I thus made.
12298 
12299 In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine
12300 dish.  The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the
12301 two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two
12302 large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a
12303 most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head,
12304 which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that
12305 some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon
12306 calves' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own,
12307 so as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads; which,
12308 indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.  And that is the reason why
12309 a young buck with an intelligent looking calf's head before him, is
12310 somehow one of the saddest sights you can see.  The head looks a sort
12311 of reproachfully at him, with an "Et tu Brute!" expression.
12312 
12313 It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
12314 unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with
12315 abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the
12316 consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly
12317 murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.  But no
12318 doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a
12319 murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by
12320 oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if
12321 any murderer does.  Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see
12322 the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead
12323 quadrupeds.  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's
12324 jaw?  Cannibals? who is not a cannibal?  I tell you it will be more
12325 tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his
12326 cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that
12327 provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee,
12328 civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground
12329 and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.
12330 
12331 But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
12332 adding insult to injury, is it?  Look at your knife-handle, there, my
12333 civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what
12334 is that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the
12335 very ox you are eating?  And what do you pick your teeth with, after
12336 devouring that fat goose?  With a feather of the same fowl.  And with
12337 what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of
12338 Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?  It is only within
12339 the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to
12340 patronise nothing but steel pens.
12341 
12342 
12343 
12344 CHAPTER 66
12345 
12346 The Shark Massacre.
12347 
12348 
12349 When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
12350 weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a
12351 general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business
12352 of cutting him in.  For that business is an exceedingly laborious
12353 one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about
12354 it.  Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the
12355 helm a'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till
12356 daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches
12357 shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the
12358 crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.
12359 
12360 But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan
12361 will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks
12362 gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours,
12363 say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by
12364 morning.  In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish
12365 do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times
12366 considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp
12367 whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some
12368 instances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity.
12369 But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod's sharks;
12370 though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have
12371 looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole
12372 round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.
12373 
12374 Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper
12375 was concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle
12376 seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the
12377 sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side,
12378 and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light
12379 over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long
12380 whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by
12381 striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only
12382 vital part.  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling
12383 hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought
12384 about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.  They
12385 viciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like
12386 flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails
12387 seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be
12388 oppositely voided by the gaping wound.  Nor was this all.  It was
12389 unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures.  A
12390 sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very
12391 joints and bones, after what might be called the individual life had
12392 departed.  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one
12393 of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried
12394 to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.
12395 
12396 
12397 *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best
12398 steel; is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general
12399 shape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named;
12400 only its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably
12401 narrower than the lower.  This weapon is always kept as sharp as
12402 possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a
12403 razor.  In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,
12404 is inserted for a handle.
12405 
12406 
12407 "Queequeg no care what god made him shark," said the savage,
12408 agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; "wedder Fejee god or
12409 Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin."
12410 
12411 
12412 
12413 CHAPTER 67
12414 
12415 Cutting In.
12416 
12417 
12418 It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!  Ex officio
12419 professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.  The ivory Pequod
12420 was turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher.  You
12421 would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the
12422 sea gods.
12423 
12424 In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other
12425 ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted
12426 green, and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of
12427 grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower
12428 mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck.  The end
12429 of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then
12430 conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles
12431 was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,
12432 weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.  And now suspended in
12433 stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their
12434 long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of
12435 the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.  This done, a
12436 broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted,
12437 and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence
12438 heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.  When instantly, the
12439 entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like
12440 the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles,
12441 quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.  More and more
12442 she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the
12443 windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at
12444 last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship
12445 rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle
12446 rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of
12447 the first strip of blubber.  Now as the blubber envelopes the whale
12448 precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the
12449 body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.
12450 For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps
12451 the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in
12452 one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the "scarf,"
12453 simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates;
12454 and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very
12455 act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft
12456 till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then
12457 cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping
12458 mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one
12459 present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may
12460 box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.
12461 
12462 One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen
12463 weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he
12464 dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the
12465 swaying mass.  Into this hole, the end of the second alternating
12466 great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,
12467 in order to prepare for what follows.  Whereupon, this accomplished
12468 swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a
12469 scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,
12470 lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the
12471 short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a
12472 blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.  The
12473 heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is
12474 peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is
12475 slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main
12476 hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the
12477 blubber-room.  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
12478 coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass
12479 of plaited serpents.  And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles
12480 hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass
12481 heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the
12482 mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing
12483 occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.
12484 
12485 
12486 
12487 CHAPTER 68
12488 
12489 The Blanket.
12490 
12491 
12492 I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
12493 of the whale.  I have had controversies about it with experienced
12494 whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.  My original opinion
12495 remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
12496 
12497 The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?  Already
12498 you know what his blubber is.  That blubber is something of the
12499 consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic
12500 and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen
12501 inches in thickness.
12502 
12503 Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
12504 creature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness,
12505 yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a
12506 presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping
12507 layer from the whale's body but that same blubber; and the outermost
12508 enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be
12509 but the skin?  True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you
12510 may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent
12511 substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only
12512 it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to
12513 being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes
12514 rather hard and brittle.  I have several such dried bits, which I use
12515 for marks in my whale-books.  It is transparent, as I said before;
12516 and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself
12517 with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence.  At any rate, it is
12518 pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you
12519 may say.  But what I am driving at here is this.  That same
12520 infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the
12521 entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin
12522 of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were
12523 simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous
12524 whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.
12525 But no more of this.
12526 
12527 Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this
12528 skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk
12529 of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in
12530 quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only
12531 three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea
12532 may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere
12533 part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.
12534 Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net
12535 weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin.
12536 
12537 In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least
12538 among the many marvels he presents.  Almost invariably it is all over
12539 obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in
12540 thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line
12541 engravings.  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
12542 isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it,
12543 as if they were engraved upon the body itself.  Nor is this all.  In
12544 some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as
12545 in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other
12546 delineations.  These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those
12547 mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that
12548 is the proper word to use in the present connexion.  By my retentive
12549 memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was
12550 much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters
12551 chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the
12552 Upper Mississippi.  Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked
12553 whale remains undecipherable.  This allusion to the Indian rocks
12554 reminds me of another thing.  Besides all the other phenomena which
12555 the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the
12556 back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the
12557 regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,
12558 altogether of an irregular, random aspect.  I should say that those
12559 New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear
12560 the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I
12561 should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm
12562 Whale in this particular.  It also seems to me that such scratches in
12563 the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for
12564 I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the
12565 species.
12566 
12567 A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
12568 the whale.  It has already been said, that it is stript from him in
12569 long pieces, called blanket-pieces.  Like most sea-terms, this one is
12570 very happy and significant.  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his
12571 blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an
12572 Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is
12573 by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is
12574 enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas,
12575 times, and tides.  What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in
12576 those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy
12577 surtout?  True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those
12578 Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded,
12579 lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that
12580 warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter
12581 would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs
12582 and warm blood.  Freeze his blood, and he dies.  How wonderful is it
12583 then--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom
12584 corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful
12585 that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in
12586 those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are
12587 sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the
12588 hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber.  But more
12589 surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the
12590 blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in
12591 summer.
12592 
12593 It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
12594 individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
12595 virtue of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model thyself
12596 after the whale!  Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.  Do thou, too,
12597 live in this world without being of it.  Be cool at the equator; keep
12598 thy blood fluid at the Pole.  Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and
12599 like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of
12600 thine own.
12601 
12602 But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!  Of
12603 erections, how few are domed like St. Peter's! of creatures, how few
12604 vast as the whale!
12605

12609 
12610 The Funeral.
12611 
12612 
12613 Haul in the chains!  Let the carcase go astern!
12614 
12615 The vast tackles have now done their duty.  The peeled white body of
12616 the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in
12617 hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.  It is still
12618 colossal.  Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it
12619 torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed
12620 with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so
12621 many insulting poniards in the whale.  The vast white headless
12622 phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that
12623 it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of
12624 fowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours and hours from the
12625 almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.  Beneath the
12626 unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
12627 wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and
12628 on, till lost in infinite perspectives.
12629 
12630 There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral!  The sea-vultures
12631 all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or
12632 speckled.  In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I
12633 ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his
12634 funeral they most piously do pounce.  Oh, horrible vultureism of
12635 earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.
12636 
12637 Nor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
12638 survives and hovers over it to scare.  Espied by some timid
12639 man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the
12640 distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the
12641 white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high
12642 against it; straightway the whale's unharming corpse, with trembling
12643 fingers is set down in the log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS
12644 HEREABOUTS: BEWARE!  And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun
12645 the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because
12646 their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held.  There's
12647 your law of precedents; there's your utility of traditions; there's
12648 the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on
12649 the earth, and now not even hovering in the air!  There's orthodoxy!
12650 
12651 Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real
12652 terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic
12653 to a world.
12654 
12655 Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend?  There are other ghosts than
12656 the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe
12657 in them.

12661 CHAPTER 70
12662 
12663 The Sphynx.
12664 
12665 
12666 It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
12667 the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded.  Now, the beheading of
12668 the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which
12669 experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not
12670 without reason.
12671 
12672 Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a
12673 neck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there,
12674 in that very place, is the thickest part of him.  Remember, also,
12675 that the surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet
12676 intervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost
12677 hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and
12678 bursting sea.  Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward
12679 circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that
12680 subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into
12681 the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear
12682 of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a
12683 critical point hard by its insertion into the skull.  Do you not
12684 marvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to
12685 behead a sperm whale?
12686 
12687 When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
12688 cable till the body is stripped.  That done, if it belong to a small
12689 whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of.  But,
12690 with a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale's
12691 head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to
12692 suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a
12693 whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn
12694 in jewellers' scales.
12695 
12696 The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
12697 was hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea,
12698 so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native
12699 element.  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,
12700 by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and
12701 every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves;
12702 there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the
12703 giant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.
12704 
12705 When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
12706 below to their dinner.  Silence reigned over the before tumultuous
12707 but now deserted deck.  An intense copper calm, like a universal
12708 yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless
12709 leaves upon the sea.
12710 
12711 A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
12712 from his cabin.  Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
12713 gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
12714 Stubb's long spade--still remaining there after the whale's
12715 Decapitation--and striking it into the lower part of the
12716 half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,
12717 and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
12718 
12719 It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
12720 intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert.  "Speak, thou
12721 vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though ungarnished
12722 with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,
12723 mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all
12724 divers, thou hast dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper
12725 sun now gleams, has moved amid this world's foundations.  Where
12726 unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot;
12727 where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with
12728 bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land,
12729 there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or diver
12730 never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side, where sleepless
12731 mothers would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw'st the
12732 locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart
12733 they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven
12734 seemed false to them.  Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by
12735 pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper
12736 midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on
12737 unharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that
12738 would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.
12739 O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an
12740 infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"
12741 
12742 "Sail ho!" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
12743 
12744 "Aye?  Well, now, that's cheering," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
12745 himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.  "That
12746 lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
12747 man.--Where away?"
12748 
12749 "Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
12750 to us!
12751 
12752 "Better and better, man.  Would now St. Paul would come along that
12753 way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!  O Nature, and O soul
12754 of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not
12755 the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning
12756 duplicate in mind."
12757 
12758 
12759 
12760 CHAPTER 71
12761 
12762 The Jeroboam's Story.
12763 
12764 
12765 Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster
12766 than the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
12767 
12768 By and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned
12769 mast-heads proved her a whale-ship.  But as she was so far to
12770 windward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other
12771 ground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.  So the signal was
12772 set to see what response would be made.
12773 
12774 Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships
12775 of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which
12776 signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective
12777 vessels attached, every captain is provided with it.  Thereby, the
12778 whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean,
12779 even at considerable distances and with no small facility.
12780 
12781 The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's
12782 setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of
12783 Nantucket.  Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the
12784 Pequod's lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the
12785 side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the
12786 visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his
12787 boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.
12788 It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board,
12789 and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod's
12790 company.  For, though himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and
12791 though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea
12792 and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to
12793 the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come
12794 into direct contact with the Pequod.
12795 
12796 But this did by no means prevent all communications.  Preserving an
12797 interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the
12798 Jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep
12799 parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by
12800 this time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though,
12801 indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the
12802 boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully
12803 brought to her proper bearings again.  Subject to this, and other the
12804 like interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between
12805 the two parties; but at intervals not without still another
12806 interruption of a very different sort.
12807 
12808 Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular
12809 appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
12810 notabilities make up all totalities.  He was a small, short, youngish
12811 man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
12812 yellow hair.  A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded
12813 walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were
12814 rolled up on his wrists.  A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in
12815 his eyes.
12816 
12817 So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
12818 exclaimed--"That's he! that's he!--the long-togged scaramouch the
12819 Town-Ho's company told us of!"  Stubb here alluded to a strange story
12820 told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
12821 previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.  According to this
12822 account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the
12823 scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost
12824 everybody in the Jeroboam.  His story was this:
12825 
12826 He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
12827 Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
12828 meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
12829 trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which
12830 he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
12831 gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.  A strange,
12832 apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for
12833 Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed
12834 a steady, common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand
12835 candidate for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage.  They engaged him; but
12836 straightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of land, his
12837 insanity broke out in a freshet.  He announced himself as the
12838 archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard.  He
12839 published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the
12840 deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica.
12841 The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;--the
12842 dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the
12843 preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel
12844 in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere
12845 of sacredness.  Moreover, they were afraid of him.  As such a man,
12846 however, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he
12847 refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would
12848 fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual's
12849 intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel
12850 forthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship and all
12851 hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried
12852 out.  So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that
12853 at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel
12854 was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain.  He was
12855 therefore forced to relinquish his plan.  Nor would they permit
12856 Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it
12857 came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship.  The
12858 consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or
12859 nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken
12860 out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague,
12861 as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but
12862 according to his good pleasure.  The sailors, mostly poor devils,
12863 cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his
12864 instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
12865 Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are
12866 true.  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to
12867 the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his
12868 measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.  But
12869 it is time to return to the Pequod.
12870 
12871 "I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks, to
12872 Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; "come on board."
12873 
12874 But now Gabriel started to his feet.
12875 
12876 "Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!  Beware of the
12877 horrible plague!"
12878 
12879 "Gabriel!  Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou must either--"  But
12880 that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its
12881 seethings drowned all speech.
12882 
12883 "Hast thou seen the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, when the boat
12884 drifted back.
12885 
12886 "Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!  Beware of the
12887 horrible tail!"
12888 
12889 "I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--"  But again the boat tore ahead
12890 as if dragged by fiends.  Nothing was said for some moments, while a
12891 succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those
12892 occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.
12893 Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently,
12894 and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than
12895 his archangel nature seemed to warrant.
12896 
12897 When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
12898 concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions
12899 from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that
12900 seemed leagued with him.
12901 
12902 It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon
12903 speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the
12904 existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking
12905 in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against
12906 attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his
12907 gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being
12908 than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But
12909 when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from
12910 the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter
12911 him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
12912 opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and
12913 forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
12914 With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
12915 perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one
12916 iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,
12917 was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies
12918 of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,
12919 while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with
12920 all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild
12921 exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for
12922 his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its
12923 quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the
12924 bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of
12925 furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc
12926 in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty
12927 yards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any
12928 oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.
12929 
12930 It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
12931 Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
12932 Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
12933 oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which
12934 the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.
12935 But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances
12936 than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of
12937 violence is discernible; the man being stark dead.
12938 
12939 The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly
12940 descried from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--"The vial! the
12941 vial!"  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further
12942 hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with
12943 added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
12944 specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general
12945 prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit
12946 one of many marks in the wide margin allowed.  He became a nameless
12947 terror to the ship.
12948 
12949 Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to
12950 him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
12951 intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer.  To
12952 which Ahab answered--"Aye."  Straightway, then, Gabriel once more
12953 started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently
12954 exclaimed, with downward pointed finger--"Think, think of the
12955 blasphemer--dead, and down there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!"
12956 
12957 Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have
12958 just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
12959 officers, if I mistake not.  Starbuck, look over the bag."
12960 
12961 Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
12962 ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
12963 depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
12964 Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only
12965 received after attaining an age of two or three years or more.
12966 
12967 Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand.  It was sorely
12968 tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in
12969 consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.  Of such a
12970 letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.
12971 
12972 "Can'st not read it?" cried Ahab.  "Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it's
12973 but a dim scrawl;--what's this?"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck
12974 took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the
12975 end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the
12976 boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.
12977 
12978 Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, "Mr. Har--yes, Mr.
12979 Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.
12980 Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!"
12981 
12982 "Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife," sighed Mayhew; "but
12983 let me have it."
12984 
12985 "Nay, keep it thyself," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art soon going
12986 that way."
12987 
12988 "Curses throttle thee!" yelled Ahab.  "Captain Mayhew, stand by now
12989 to receive it"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck's hands,
12990 he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
12991 boat.  But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from
12992 rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that,
12993 as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager
12994 hand.  He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and
12995 impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.
12996 It fell at Ahab's feet.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to
12997 give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat
12998 rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
12999 
13000 As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the
13001 jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to
13002 this wild affair.
13003 
13004 
13005 
13006 CHAPTER 72
13007 
13008 The Monkey-Rope.
13009 
13010 
13011 In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
13012 there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.  Now
13013 hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.  There
13014 is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time
13015 everything has to be done everywhere.  It is much the same with him
13016 who endeavors the description of the scene.  We must now retrace our
13017 way a little.  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in
13018 the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original
13019 hole there cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so clumsy and
13020 weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?  It was
13021 inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was,
13022 as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special
13023 purpose referred to.  But in very many cases, circumstances require
13024 that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing
13025 or stripping operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies
13026 almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated
13027 upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the
13028 poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the
13029 water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On
13030 the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a
13031 shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to
13032 uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as
13033 will presently be seen.
13034 
13035 Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the
13036 bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful
13037 duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon
13038 the dead whale's back.  You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a
13039 dancing-ape by a long cord.  Just so, from the ship's steep side, did
13040 I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called
13041 in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas
13042 belted round his waist.
13043 
13044 It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we
13045 proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at
13046 both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my
13047 narrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the
13048 time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more,
13049 then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,
13050 it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese
13051 ligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;
13052 nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the
13053 hempen bond entailed.
13054 
13055 So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
13056 that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
13057 perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
13058 company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and
13059 that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into
13060 unmerited disaster and death.  Therefore, I saw that here was a sort
13061 of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could
13062 have so gross an injustice.  And yet still further pondering--while I
13063 jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would
13064 threaten to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this
13065 situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that
13066 breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese
13067 connexion with a plurality of other mortals.  If your banker breaks,
13068 you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your
13069 pills, you die.  True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you
13070 may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of
13071 life.  But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,
13072 sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.
13073 Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the
13074 management of one end of it.*
13075 
13076 
13077 *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the
13078 Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.  This
13079 improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
13080 than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
13081 possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
13082 monkey-rope holder.
13083 
13084 
13085 I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
13086 whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the
13087 incessant rolling and swaying of both.  But this was not the only
13088 jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled by the massacre made
13089 upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly
13090 allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the
13091 carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
13092 
13093 And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
13094 aside with his floundering feet.  A thing altogether incredible were
13095 it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
13096 miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
13097 
13098 Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
13099 ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
13100 them.  Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and
13101 then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of
13102 what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still
13103 another protection.  Suspended over the side in one of the stages,
13104 Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of
13105 keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they
13106 could reach.  This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very
13107 disinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best
13108 happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from
13109 the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half
13110 hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs
13111 would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I
13112 suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook--poor
13113 Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life
13114 into the hands of his gods.
13115 
13116 Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
13117 and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters
13118 it, after all?  Are you not the precious image of each and all of us
13119 men in this whaling world?  That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is
13120 Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what
13121 between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor
13122 lad.
13123 
13124 But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.  For
13125 now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at
13126 last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
13127 trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
13128 consolatory glance hands him--what?  Some hot Cognac?  No! hands him,
13129 ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
13130 
13131 "Ginger?  Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
13132 "Yes, this must be ginger," peering into the as yet untasted cup.
13133 Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards
13134 the astonished steward slowly saying, "Ginger? ginger? and will you
13135 have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
13136 ginger?  Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
13137 kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?  Ginger!--what the devil is
13138 ginger?--sea-coal? firewood?--lucifer
13139 matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what the devil is ginger, I say, that
13140 you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here."
13141 
13142 "There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
13143 business," he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
13144 come from forward.  "Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of
13145 it, if you please."  Then watching the mate's countenance, he added,
13146 "The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and
13147 jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward
13148 an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters
13149 by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?"
13150 
13151 "I trust not," said Starbuck, "it is poor stuff enough."
13152 
13153 "Aye, aye, steward," cried Stubb, "we'll teach you to drug it
13154 harpooneer; none of your apothecary's medicine here; you want to
13155 poison us, do ye?  You have got out insurances on our lives and want
13156 to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"
13157 
13158 "It was not me," cried Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity that brought
13159 the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any
13160 spirits, but only this ginger-jub--so she called it."
13161 
13162 "Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to
13163 the lockers, and get something better.  I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
13164 Starbuck.  It is the captain's orders--grog for the harpooneer on a
13165 whale."
13166 
13167 "Enough," replied Starbuck, "only don't hit him again, but--"
13168 
13169 "Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something
13170 of that sort; and this fellow's a weazel.  What were you about
13171 saying, sir?"
13172 
13173 "Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself."
13174 
13175 When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
13176 sort of tea-caddy in the other.  The first contained strong spirits,
13177 and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and
13178 that was freely given to the waves.
13179 
13180 
13181 
13182 CHAPTER 73
13183 
13184 Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him.
13185 
13186 
13187 It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's
13188 prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side.  But we must let it
13189 continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to
13190 it.  For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now
13191 for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
13192 
13193 Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
13194 drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
13195 gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
13196 Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
13197 anywhere near.  And though all hands commonly disdained the capture
13198 of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not
13199 commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed
13200 numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now
13201 that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the
13202 surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should
13203 be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
13204 
13205 Nor was this long wanting.  Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
13206 boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit.  Pulling
13207 further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the
13208 men at the mast-head.  But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great
13209 heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft
13210 that one or both the boats must be fast.  An interval passed and the
13211 boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards
13212 the ship by the towing whale.  So close did the monster come to the
13213 hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly
13214 going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly
13215 disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel.  "Cut, cut!" was
13216 the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on
13217 the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's
13218 side.  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not
13219 sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the
13220 same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.
13221 For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while
13222 they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still
13223 plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take
13224 them under.  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain.
13225 And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift
13226 tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the
13227 strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under
13228 her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,
13229 that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the
13230 whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to
13231 fly.  But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his
13232 course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
13233 him, so that they performed a complete circuit.
13234 
13235 Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
13236 flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for
13237 lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
13238 multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's
13239 body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking
13240 at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting
13241 fountains that poured from the smitten rock.
13242 
13243 At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
13244 turned upon his back a corpse.
13245 
13246 While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his
13247 flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing,
13248 some conversation ensued between them.
13249 
13250 "I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard," said
13251 Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with
13252 so ignoble a leviathan.
13253 
13254 "Wants with it?" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's
13255 bow, "did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm
13256 Whale's head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a
13257 Right Whale's on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that
13258 ship can never afterwards capsize?"
13259 
13260 "Why not?
13261 
13262 "I don't know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying
13263 so, and he seems to know all about ships' charms.  But I sometimes
13264 think he'll charm the ship to no good at last.  I don't half like
13265 that chap, Stubb.  Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort
13266 of carved into a snake's head, Stubb?"
13267 
13268 "Sink him!  I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of
13269 a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by;
13270 look down there, Flask"--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion
13271 of both hands--"Aye, will I!  Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the
13272 devil in disguise.  Do you believe that cock and bull story about his
13273 having been stowed away on board ship?  He's the devil, I say.  The
13274 reason why you don't see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of
13275 sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess.  Blast him!
13276 now that I think of it, he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the
13277 toes of his boots."
13278 
13279 "He sleeps in his boots, don't he?  He hasn't got any hammock; but
13280 I've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging."
13281 
13282 "No doubt, and it's because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do
13283 ye see, in the eye of the rigging."
13284 
13285 "What's the old man have so much to do with him for?"
13286 
13287 "Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose."
13288 
13289 "Bargain?--about what?"
13290 
13291 "Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
13292 the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
13293 his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
13294 he'll surrender Moby Dick."
13295 
13296 "Pooh!  Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?"
13297 
13298 "I don't know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
13299 one, I tell ye.  Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the
13300 old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
13301 gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home.  Well,
13302 he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted.  The devil,
13303 switching his hoofs, up and says, 'I want John.'  'What for?' says
13304 the old governor.  'What business is that of yours,' says the devil,
13305 getting mad,--'I want to use him.'  'Take him,' says the
13306 governor--and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John the
13307 Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I'll eat this whale
13308 in one mouthful.  But look sharp--ain't you all ready there?  Well,
13309 then, pull ahead, and let's get the whale alongside."
13310 
13311 "I think I remember some such story as you were telling," said Flask,
13312 when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
13313 towards the ship, "but I can't remember where."
13314 
13315 "Three Spaniards?  Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes?
13316 Did ye read it there, Flask?  I guess ye did?"
13317 
13318 "No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though.  But now, tell me,
13319 Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now,
13320 was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"
13321 
13322 "Am I the same man that helped kill this whale?  Doesn't the devil
13323 live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead?  Did you ever
13324 see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil?  And if the devil
13325 has a latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he
13326 can crawl into a porthole?  Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"
13327 
13328 "How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?"
13329 
13330 "Do you see that mainmast there?" pointing to the ship; "well, that's
13331 the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod's hold, and
13332 string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well,
13333 that wouldn't begin to be Fedallah's age.  Nor all the coopers in
13334 creation couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough."
13335 
13336 "But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that
13337 you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.
13338 Now, if he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is
13339 going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him
13340 overboard--tell me that?
13341 
13342 "Give him a good ducking, anyhow."
13343 
13344 "But he'd crawl back."
13345 
13346 "Duck him again; and keep ducking him."
13347 
13348 "Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though--yes,
13349 and drown you--what then?"
13350 
13351 "I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black
13352 eyes that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin
13353 again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
13354 lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.
13355 Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I'm afraid of the devil?  Who's
13356 afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put
13357 him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about
13358 kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the
13359 people the devil kidnapped, he'd roast for him?  There's a governor!"
13360 
13361 "Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?"
13362 
13363 "Do I suppose it?  You'll know it before long, Flask.  But I am going
13364 now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very
13365 suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and
13366 say--Look here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss,
13367 by the Lord I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to
13368 the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail
13369 will come short off at the stump--do you see; and then, I rather
13370 guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak
13371 off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his
13372 legs."
13373 
13374 "And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?"
13375 
13376 "Do with it?  Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?"
13377 
13378 "Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,
13379 Stubb?"
13380 
13381 "Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship."
13382 
13383 The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
13384 where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
13385 securing him.
13386 
13387 "Didn't I tell you so?" said Flask; "yes, you'll soon see this right
13388 whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's."
13389 
13390 In good time, Flask's saying proved true.  As before, the Pequod
13391 steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by the
13392 counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely
13393 strained, you may well believe.  So, when on one side you hoist in
13394 Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist
13395 in Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight.  Thus,
13396 some minds for ever keep trimming boat.  Oh, ye foolish! throw all
13397 these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and
13398 right.
13399 
13400 In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
13401 ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
13402 case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut
13403 off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately
13404 removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone
13405 attached to what is called the crown-piece.  But nothing like this,
13406 in the present case, had been done.  The carcases of both whales had
13407 dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule
13408 carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
13409 
13410 Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever
13411 and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his
13412 own hand.  And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his
13413 shadow; while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only
13414 to blend with, and lengthen Ahab's.  As the crew toiled on,
13415 Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these
13416 passing things.
13417 
13418 
13419 
13420 CHAPTER 74
13421 
13422 The Sperm Whale's Head--Contrasted View.
13423 
13424 
13425 Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
13426 join them, and lay together our own.
13427 
13428 Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
13429 Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales
13430 regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two
13431 extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external
13432 difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a
13433 head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we
13434 may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the
13435 deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance
13436 to study practical cetology than here?
13437 
13438 In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
13439 these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there
13440 is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the
13441 Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm
13442 Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense
13443 superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present
13444 instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt
13445 colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and
13446 large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically
13447 call a "grey-headed whale."
13448 
13449 Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the
13450 two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side
13451 of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if
13452 you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you
13453 would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it
13454 to the magnitude of the head.
13455 
13456 Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is
13457 plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
13458 than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the
13459 whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,
13460 for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey
13461 objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only
13462 command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight
13463 side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your
13464 bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted
13465 in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he
13466 were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two
13467 backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
13468 fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,
13469 but his eyes?
13470 
13471 Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the
13472 eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so
13473 as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar
13474 position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many
13475 cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great
13476 mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must
13477 wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.
13478 The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,
13479 and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be
13480 profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be
13481 said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined
13482 sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are
13483 separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing
13484 the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to
13485 be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader
13486 in some subsequent scenes.
13487 
13488 A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
13489 visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with
13490 a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of
13491 seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically
13492 seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's
13493 experience will teach him, that though he can take in an
13494 undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite
13495 impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two
13496 things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant
13497 of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.
13498 But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each
13499 by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,
13500 in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will
13501 be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,
13502 then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must
13503 simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
13504 combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of
13505 time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of
13506 him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then
13507 is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
13508 simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct
13509 problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
13510 incongruity in this comparison.
13511 
13512 It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
13513 extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
13514 beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
13515 frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
13516 proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
13517 divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve
13518 them.
13519 
13520 But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are
13521 an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads
13522 for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external
13523 leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a
13524 quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the
13525 eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be
13526 observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of
13527 the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely
13528 and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite
13529 imperceptible from without.
13530 
13531 Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
13532 world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear
13533 which is smaller than a hare's?  But if his eyes were broad as the
13534 lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the
13535 porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or
13536 sharper of hearing?  Not at all.--Why then do you try to "enlarge"
13537 your mind?  Subtilize it.
13538 
13539 Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand,
13540 cant over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up;
13541 then, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the
13542 mouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from
13543 it, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth
13544 Cave of his stomach.  But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look
13545 about us where we are.  What a really beautiful and chaste-looking
13546 mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a
13547 glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.
13548 
13549 But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
13550 like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at
13551 one end, instead of one side.  If you pry it up, so as to get it
13552 overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific
13553 portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the
13554 fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force.  But far
13555 more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see
13556 some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw,
13557 some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at right-angles with
13558 his body, for all the world like a ship's jib-boom.  This whale is
13559 not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
13560 hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have
13561 relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
13562 reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws
13563 upon him.
13564 
13565 In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised
13566 artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of
13567 extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard
13568 white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious
13569 articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to
13570 riding-whips.
13571 
13572 With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were
13573 an anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the
13574 other work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished
13575 dentists, are set to drawing teeth.  With a keen cutting-spade,
13576 Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts,
13577 and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as
13578 Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands.  There
13579 are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down,
13580 but undecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion.  The jaw is
13581 afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building
13582 houses.
13583 
13584 
13585 
13586 CHAPTER 75
13587 
13588 The Right Whale's Head--Contrasted View.
13589 
13590 
13591 Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right
13592 Whale's head.
13593 
13594 As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a
13595 Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
13596 rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather
13597 inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe.  Two hundred
13598 years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a
13599 shoemaker's last.  And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of
13600 the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
13601 lodged, she and all her progeny.
13602 
13603 But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume
13604 different aspects, according to your point of view.  If you stand on
13605 its summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take
13606 the whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the
13607 apertures in its sounding-board.  Then, again, if you fix your eye
13608 upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the
13609 mass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the
13610 "crown," and the Southern fishers the "bonnet" of the Right Whale;
13611 fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the
13612 trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its crotch.  At any
13613 rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this
13614 bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless,
13615 indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term "crown" also
13616 bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
13617 thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the
13618 sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this
13619 marvellous manner.  But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky
13620 looking fellow to grace a diadem.  Look at that hanging lower lip!
13621 what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's
13622 measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and
13623 pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.
13624 
13625 A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
13626 The fissure is about a foot across.  Probably the mother during an
13627 important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when
13628 earthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip, as over a
13629 slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth.  Upon my word were I
13630 at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam.
13631 Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went?  The roof is about
13632 twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were
13633 a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,
13634 present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats
13635 of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the
13636 upper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds
13637 which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.  The edges of these
13638 bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale
13639 strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
13640 fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding
13641 time.  In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural
13642 order, there are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges,
13643 whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age, as the age of an
13644 oak by its circular rings.  Though the certainty of this criterion is
13645 far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical
13646 probability.  At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far
13647 greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem
13648 reasonable.
13649 
13650 In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
13651 concerning these blinds.  One voyager in Purchas calls them the
13652 wondrous "whiskers" inside of the whale's mouth;* another, "hogs'
13653 bristles"; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following
13654 elegant language: "There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing
13655 on each side of his upper CHOP, which arch over his tongue on each
13656 side of his mouth."
13657 
13658 
13659 *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,
13660 or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on
13661 the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw.  Sometimes these
13662 tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
13663 countenance.
13664 
13665 
13666 As every one knows, these same "hogs' bristles," "fins," "whiskers,"
13667 "blinds," or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks
13668 and other stiffening contrivances.  But in this particular, the
13669 demand has long been on the decline.  It was in Queen Anne's time
13670 that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale being then all the
13671 fashion.  And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the
13672 jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the
13673 like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for
13674 protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.
13675 
13676 But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
13677 standing in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh.  Seeing
13678 all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you
13679 not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing
13680 upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of
13681 the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the
13682 floor of the mouth.  It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in
13683 pieces in hoisting it on deck.  This particular tongue now before us;
13684 at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it
13685 will yield you about that amount of oil.
13686 
13687 Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
13688 with--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
13689 different heads.  To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no
13690 great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
13691 of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's.  Nor in the Sperm Whale are
13692 there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely
13693 anything of a tongue.  Again, the Right Whale has two external
13694 spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
13695 
13696 Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
13697 lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the
13698 other will not be very long in following.
13699 
13700 Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there?  It is the
13701 same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead
13702 seem now faded away.  I think his broad brow to be full of a
13703 prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to
13704 death.  But mark the other head's expression.  See that amazing lower
13705 lip, pressed by accident against the vessel's side, so as firmly to
13706 embrace the jaw.  Does not this whole head seem to speak of an
13707 enormous practical resolution in facing death?  This Right Whale I
13708 take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might
13709 have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.
13710 
13711 
13712 
13713 CHAPTER 76
13714 
13715 The Battering-Ram.
13716 
13717 
13718 Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have
13719 you, as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its
13720 front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.  I would have you
13721 investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
13722 unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power
13723 may be lodged there.  Here is a vital point; for you must either
13724 satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain
13725 an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true
13726 events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.
13727 
13728 You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm
13729 Whale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane
13730 to the water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes
13731 considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the
13732 long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that
13733 the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed,
13734 as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.  Moreover you
13735 observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he
13736 has--his spout hole--is on the top of his head; you observe that his
13737 eyes and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his
13738 entire length from the front.  Wherefore, you must now have perceived
13739 that the front of the Sperm Whale's head is a dead, blind wall,
13740 without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever.
13741 Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower,
13742 backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the
13743 slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from
13744 the forehead do you come to the full cranial development.  So that
13745 this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.  Finally, though, as
13746 will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate
13747 oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance
13748 which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy.  In some
13749 previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body
13750 of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.  Just so with the head;
13751 but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so
13752 thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not
13753 handled it.  The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted
13754 by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it.  It is as
13755 though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs.
13756 I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
13757 
13758 Bethink yourself also of another thing.  When two large, loaded
13759 Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the
13760 docks, what do the sailors do?  They do not suspend between them, at
13761 the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or
13762 wood.  No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork,
13763 enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide.  That bravely and
13764 uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken
13765 handspikes and iron crow-bars.  By itself this sufficiently
13766 illustrates the obvious fact I drive at.  But supplementary to this,
13767 it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess
13768 what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of
13769 distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,
13770 has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise
13771 inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether
13772 beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the
13773 water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;
13774 considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically
13775 occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs
13776 there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected
13777 connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric
13778 distension and contraction.  If this be so, fancy the
13779 irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
13780 destructive of all elements contributes.
13781 
13782 Now, mark.  Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
13783 wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
13784 mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled
13785 wood is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the
13786 smallest insect.  So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all
13787 the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in
13788 this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more
13789 inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
13790 ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the
13791 Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
13792 the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your
13793 eye-brow.  For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
13794 sentimentalist in Truth.  But clear Truth is a thing for salamander
13795 giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials
13796 then?  What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's
13797 veil at Lais?
13798 
13799 
13800 
13801 CHAPTER 77
13802 
13803 The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
13804 
13805 
13806 Now comes the Baling of the Case.  But to comprehend it aright, you
13807 must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing
13808 operated upon.
13809 
13810 Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
13811 inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the
13812 lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the
13813 upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end
13814 forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale.  At the
13815 middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and
13816 then you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally
13817 divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.
13818 
13819 
13820 *Quoin is not a Euclidean term.  It belongs to the pure nautical
13821 mathematics.  I know not that it has been defined before.  A quoin is
13822 a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by
13823 the steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of
13824 both sides.
13825 
13826 
13827 The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb
13828 of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
13829 infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
13830 extent.  The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the
13831 great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.  And as that famous great
13832 tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited
13833 forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical
13834 adornment of his wondrous tun.  Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was
13835 always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the
13836 Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most
13837 precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized
13838 spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state.
13839 Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
13840 the creature.  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
13841 exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
13842 forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate
13843 ice is just forming in water.  A large whale's case generally yields
13844 about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable
13845 circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles
13846 away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of
13847 securing what you can.
13848 
13849 I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
13850 coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
13851 possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
13852 the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm
13853 Whale's case.
13854 
13855 It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
13856 embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and
13857 since--as has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third
13858 of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at
13859 eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six
13860 feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and
13861 down against a ship's side.
13862 
13863 As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought
13864 close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
13865 spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful,
13866 lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and
13867 wastingly let out its invaluable contents.  It is this decapitated
13868 end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water,
13869 and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose
13870 hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in
13871 that quarter.
13872 
13873 Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous
13874 and--in this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the
13875 Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.
13876 
13877 
13878 
13879 CHAPTER 78
13880 
13881 Cistern and Buckets.
13882 
13883 
13884 Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his
13885 erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm,
13886 to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun.  He has
13887 carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two
13888 parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block.  Securing this
13889 block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of
13890 the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck.
13891 Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through
13892 the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head.
13893 There--still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he
13894 vivaciously cries--he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good
13895 people to prayers from the top of a tower.  A short-handled sharp
13896 spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper
13897 place to begin breaking into the Tun.  In this business he proceeds
13898 very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding
13899 the walls to find where the gold is masoned in.  By the time this
13900 cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a
13901 well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the
13902 other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or
13903 three alert hands.  These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of
13904 the Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
13905 Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the
13906 bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the
13907 word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all
13908 bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk.  Carefully lowered
13909 from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed
13910 hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub.  Then remounting aloft,
13911 it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will
13912 yield no more.  Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole
13913 harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some
13914 twenty feet of the pole have gone down.
13915 
13916 Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
13917 several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at
13918 once a queer accident happened.  Whether it was that Tashtego, that
13919 wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment
13920 his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head;
13921 or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or
13922 whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without
13923 stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no
13924 telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket
13925 came suckingly up--my God! poor Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating
13926 bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this
13927 great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went
13928 clean out of sight!
13929 
13930 "Man overboard!" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation
13931 first came to his senses.  "Swing the bucket this way!" and putting
13932 one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold
13933 on the whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the
13934 head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom.
13935 Meantime, there was a terrible tumult.  Looking over the side, they
13936 saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the
13937 surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous
13938 idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by
13939 those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.
13940 
13941 At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was
13942 clearing the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting
13943 tackles--a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable
13944 horror of all, one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore
13945 out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till
13946 the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg.  The one
13947 remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed
13948 every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more
13949 likely from the violent motions of the head.
13950 
13951 "Come down, come down!" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one
13952 hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should
13953 drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the
13954 foul line, rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well,
13955 meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted
13956 out.
13957 
13958 "In heaven's name, man," cried Stubb, "are you ramming home a
13959 cartridge there?--Avast!  How will that help him; jamming that
13960 iron-bound bucket on top of his head?  Avast, will ye!"
13961 
13962 "Stand clear of the tackle!" cried a voice like the bursting of a
13963 rocket.
13964 
13965 Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
13966 dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool;
13967 the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her
13968 glittering copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now
13969 over the sailors' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a
13970 thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous
13971 tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down
13972 to the bottom of the sea!  But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared
13973 away, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for
13974 one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks.  The next, a loud
13975 splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue.  One
13976 packed rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple,
13977 as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the
13978 diver could be seen.  Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside,
13979 and pushed a little off from the ship.
13980 
13981 "Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging
13982 perch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm
13983 thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm
13984 thrust forth from the grass over a grave.
13985 
13986 "Both! both!--it is both!"--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;
13987 and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand,
13988 and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.  Drawn into
13989 the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego
13990 was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
13991 
13992 Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after
13993 the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made
13994 side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;
13995 then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and
13996 upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that
13997 upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well
13998 knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great
13999 trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and
14000 toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next
14001 trial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the
14002 great head itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.
14003 
14004 And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
14005 Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was
14006 successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward
14007 and apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to
14008 be forgotten.  Midwifery should be taught in the same course with
14009 fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.
14010 
14011 I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to
14012 seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
14013 either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an
14014 accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
14015 the Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of
14016 the Sperm Whale's well.
14017 
14018 But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?  We
14019 thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the
14020 lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink
14021 in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself.  We have
14022 thee there.  Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash
14023 fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents,
14024 leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double
14025 welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than
14026 the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.  But
14027 the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present
14028 instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head
14029 remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
14030 deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing
14031 his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.  Yes, it was a
14032 running delivery, so it was.
14033 
14034 Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
14035 perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
14036 spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
14037 and sanctum sanctorum of the whale.  Only one sweeter end can readily
14038 be recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking
14039 honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of
14040 it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died
14041 embalmed.  How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's
14042 honey head, and sweetly perished there?

14047 
14048 The Prairie.
14049 
14050 
14051 To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
14052 Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
14053 as yet undertaken.  Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful
14054 as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of
14055 Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the
14056 Dome of the Pantheon.  Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater
14057 not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively
14058 studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in
14059 detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein.  Nor
14060 have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints
14061 touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man.
14062 Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the
14063 application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my
14064 endeavor.  I try all things; I achieve what I can.
14065 
14066 Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.
14067 He has no proper nose.  And since the nose is the central and most
14068 conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
14069 finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that
14070 its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely
14071 affect the countenance of the whale.  For as in landscape gardening,
14072 a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost
14073 indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be
14074 physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of
14075 the nose.  Dash the nose from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a sorry
14076 remainder!  Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all
14077 his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
14078 sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.  Nay, it
14079 is an added grandeur.  A nose to the whale would have been
14080 impertinent.  As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his
14081 vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never
14082 insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled.  A
14083 pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even
14084 when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.
14085 
14086 In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view
14087 to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.
14088 This aspect is sublime.
14089 
14090 In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with
14091 the morning.  In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the
14092 bull has a touch of the grand in it.  Pushing heavy cannon up
14093 mountain defiles, the elephant's brow is majestic.  Human or animal,
14094 the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German
14095 Emperors to their decrees.  It signifies--"God: done this day by my
14096 hand."  But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the
14097 brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line.
14098 Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise
14099 so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear,
14100 eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead's
14101 wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to
14102 drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
14103 But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
14104 inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in
14105 that full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more
14106 forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature.  For
14107 you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed;
14108 no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing
14109 but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles;
14110 dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.  Nor, in
14111 profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its
14112 grandeur does not domineer upon you so.  In profile, you plainly
14113 perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the
14114 forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of genius.
14115 
14116 But how?  Genius in the Sperm Whale?  Has the Sperm Whale ever
14117 written a book, spoken a speech?  No, his great genius is declared in
14118 his doing nothing particular to prove it.  It is moreover declared in
14119 his pyramidical silence.  And this reminds me that had the great
14120 Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been
14121 deified by their child-magian thoughts.  They deified the crocodile
14122 of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale
14123 has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be
14124 incapable of protrusion.  If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical
14125 nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods
14126 of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky;
14127 in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat,
14128 the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.
14129 
14130 Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.  But there
14131 is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man's and every
14132 being's face.  Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a
14133 passing fable.  If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty
14134 languages, could not read the simplest peasant's face in its
14135 profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope
14136 to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow?  I but put that
14137 brow before you.  Read it if you can.

14141 CHAPTER 80
14142 
14143 The Nut.
14144 
14145 
14146 If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist
14147 his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
14148 square.
14149 
14150 In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty
14151 feet in length.  Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this
14152 skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting
14153 throughout on a level base.  But in life--as we have elsewhere
14154 seen--this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared
14155 by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm.  At the
14156 high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while
14157 under the long floor of this crater--in another cavity seldom
14158 exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth--reposes the
14159 mere handful of this monster's brain.  The brain is at least twenty
14160 feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its
14161 vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified
14162 fortifications of Quebec.  So like a choice casket is it secreted in
14163 him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the
14164 Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one
14165 formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.  Lying in strange
14166 folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems
14167 more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that
14168 mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.
14169 
14170 It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan,
14171 in the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion.  As for
14172 his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any.
14173 The whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
14174 common world.
14175 
14176 If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
14177 of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
14178 resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and
14179 from the same point of view.  Indeed, place this reversed skull
14180 (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls,
14181 and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the
14182 depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you
14183 would say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.  And by
14184 those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his
14185 prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest,
14186 though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted
14187 potency is.
14188 
14189 But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,
14190 you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have
14191 another idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost any
14192 quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its
14193 vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing
14194 rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.  It is a German conceit,
14195 that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls.  But the
14196 curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the
14197 first men to perceive.  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me,
14198 in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of
14199 which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow
14200 of his canoe.  Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an
14201 important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
14202 cerebellum through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a
14203 man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.  I would
14204 rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.  A thin
14205 joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.  I rejoice
14206 in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I
14207 fling half out to the world.
14208 
14209 Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His
14210 cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in
14211 that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches
14212 across, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the
14213 base downwards.  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the
14214 canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of
14215 large capacity.  Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the
14216 same strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and
14217 directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for
14218 many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord
14219 remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.
14220 Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and
14221 map out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this
14222 light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is
14223 more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his
14224 spinal cord.
14225 
14226 But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
14227 would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to
14228 the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not, rises
14229 over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,
14230 the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then, I
14231 should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness
14232 in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable, you
14233 will yet have reason to know.
14234 
14235 
14236 
14237 CHAPTER 81
14238 
14239 The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
14240 
14241 
14242 The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,
14243 Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.
14244 
14245 At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
14246 Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
14247 intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
14248 their flag in the Pacific.
14249 
14250 For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
14251 While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and
14252 dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently
14253 standing in the bows instead of the stern.
14254 
14255 "What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to
14256 something wavingly held by the German.  "Impossible!--a lamp-feeder!"
14257 
14258 "Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck;
14259 he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see
14260 that big tin can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water.
14261 Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman."
14262 
14263 "Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
14264 He's out of oil, and has come a-begging."
14265 
14266 However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on
14267 the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the
14268 old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a
14269 thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer
14270 did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
14271 
14272 As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
14273 heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
14274 soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
14275 turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
14276 remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
14277 profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
14278 single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding
14279 by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is
14280 technically called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well
14281 deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
14282 
14283 His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
14284 ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
14285 mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick,
14286 that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he
14287 slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
14288 
14289 Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German
14290 boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the
14291 Pequod's keels.  There were eight whales, an average pod.  Aware of
14292 their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight
14293 before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of
14294 horses in harness.  They left a great, wide wake, as though
14295 continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.
14296 
14297 Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
14298 humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
14299 by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
14300 afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity.  Whether this
14301 whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
14302 not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
14303 Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
14304 must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad
14305 muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
14306 currents meet.  His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming
14307 forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn
14308 shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
14309 seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the
14310 waters behind him to upbubble.
14311 
14312 "Who's got some paregoric?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm
14313 afraid.  Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!  Adverse
14314 winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.  It's the first foul
14315 wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw
14316 so before? it must be, he's lost his tiller."
14317 
14318 As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
14319 load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
14320 way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then
14321 partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his
14322 devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.  Whether he
14323 had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were
14324 hard to say.
14325 
14326 "Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded
14327 arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
14328 
14329 "Mind he don't sling thee with it," cried Starbuck.  "Give way, or
14330 the German will have him."
14331 
14332 With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
14333 one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
14334 valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
14335 going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit
14336 for the time.  At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the
14337 three German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,
14338 Derick's boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
14339 foreign rivals.  The only thing they feared, was, that from being
14340 already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
14341 before they could completely overtake and pass him.  As for Derick,
14342 he seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and
14343 occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
14344 other boats.
14345 
14346 "The ungracious and ungrateful dog!" cried Starbuck; "he mocks and
14347 dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes
14348 ago!"--then in his old intense whisper--"Give way, greyhounds!  Dog
14349 to it!"
14350 
14351 "I tell ye what it is, men"--cried Stubb to his crew--"it's against
14352 my religion to get mad; but I'd like to eat that villainous
14353 Yarman--Pull--won't ye?  Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?  Do
14354 ye love brandy?  A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man.  Come,
14355 why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel?  Who's that been dropping
14356 an anchor overboard--we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed.  Halloo,
14357 here's grass growing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast
14358 there's budding.  This won't do, boys.  Look at that Yarman!  The
14359 short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?"
14360 
14361 "Oh! see the suds he makes!" cried Flask, dancing up and down--"What
14362 a hump--Oh, DO pile on the beef--lays like a log!  Oh! my lads, DO
14363 spring--slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads--baked
14364 clams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, spring,--he's a hundred barreller--don't
14365 lose him now--don't oh, DON'T!--see that Yarman--Oh,
14366 won't ye pull for your duff, my lads--such a sog! such a sogger!
14367 Don't ye love sperm?  There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a
14368 bank!--a whole bank!  The bank of England!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What's
14369 that Yarman about now?"
14370 
14371 At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at
14372 the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double
14373 view of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically
14374 accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
14375 
14376 "The unmannerly Dutch dogger!" cried Stubb.  "Pull now, men, like
14377 fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils.  What
14378 d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in
14379 two-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead?  What d'ye say?"
14380 
14381 "I say, pull like god-dam,"--cried the Indian.
14382 
14383 Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the
14384 Pequod's three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so
14385 disposed, momentarily neared him.  In that fine, loose, chivalrous
14386 attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three
14387 mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with
14388 an exhilarating cry of, "There she slides, now!  Hurrah for the
14389 white-ash breeze!  Down with the Yarman!  Sail over him!"
14390 
14391 But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
14392 their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had
14393 not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught
14394 the blade of his midship oarsman.  While this clumsy lubber was
14395 striving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's
14396 boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a
14397 mighty rage;--that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.
14398 With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly
14399 ranged up on the German's quarter.  An instant more, and all four
14400 boats were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake, while
14401 stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he
14402 made.
14403 
14404 It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.  The whale was
14405 now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
14406 tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
14407 fright.  Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering
14408 flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically
14409 sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating
14410 fin.  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted
14411 broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical
14412 hawks.  But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make
14413 known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was
14414 chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking
14415 respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him
14416 unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis
14417 jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man
14418 who so pitied.
14419 
14420 Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's
14421 boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game,
14422 Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually
14423 long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.
14424 
14425 But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
14426 three tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to
14427 their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed
14428 their barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their
14429 three Nantucket irons entered the whale.  Blinding vapours of foam and
14430 white-fire!  The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's
14431 headlong rush, bumped the German's aside with such force, that both
14432 Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over
14433 by the three flying keels.
14434 
14435 "Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," cried Stubb, casting a passing
14436 glance upon them as he shot by; "ye'll be picked up presently--all
14437 right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you
14438 know--relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! this is the way to sail
14439 now.  Every keel a sunbeam!  Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin
14440 kettles at the tail of a mad cougar!  This puts me in mind of
14441 fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain--makes the
14442 wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there's
14443 danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a hill.  Hurrah!
14444 this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy Jones--all a
14445 rush down an endless inclined plane!  Hurrah! this whale carries the
14446 everlasting mail!"
14447 
14448 But the monster's run was a brief one.  Giving a sudden gasp, he
14449 tumultuously sounded.  With a grating rush, the three lines flew
14450 round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in
14451 them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding
14452 would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,
14453 they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
14454 last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
14455 the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the
14456 blue--the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while
14457 the three sterns tilted high in the air.  And the whale soon ceasing
14458 to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of
14459 expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.  But
14460 though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is
14461 this "holding on," as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp
14462 barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments
14463 the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his
14464 foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
14465 doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but
14466 reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under
14467 water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous
14468 surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000
14469 square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what
14470 an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even
14471 here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a
14472 whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!
14473 It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman
14474 has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with
14475 all their guns, and stores, and men on board.
14476 
14477 As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
14478 into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
14479 sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its
14480 depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that
14481 silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing
14482 and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were
14483 visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin
14484 threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an
14485 eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.
14486 Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--"Canst
14487 thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?
14488 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart,
14489 nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make
14490 him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of
14491 a spear!"  This the creature? this he?  Oh! that unfulfilments should
14492 follow the prophets.  For with the strength of a thousand thighs in
14493 his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea,
14494 to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!
14495 
14496 In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
14497 sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
14498 enough to shade half Xerxes' army.  Who can tell how appalling to the
14499 wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his
14500 head!
14501 
14502 "Stand by, men; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines
14503 suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to
14504 them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,
14505 so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,
14506 relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the
14507 boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a
14508 dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.
14509 
14510 "Haul in!  Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising."
14511 
14512 The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth
14513 could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
14514 dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
14515 ship's lengths of the hunters.
14516 
14517 His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land
14518 animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their
14519 veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least
14520 instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one
14521 of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure
14522 of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point
14523 as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole
14524 arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary
14525 pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may
14526 be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the
14527 quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
14528 fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a
14529 considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose
14530 source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.
14531 Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew
14532 over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they
14533 were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept
14534 continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was
14535 only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture
14536 into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no
14537 vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they
14538 significantly call it, was untouched.
14539 
14540 As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
14541 his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
14542 revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,
14543 were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of
14544 the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's
14545 eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable
14546 to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one
14547 arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in
14548 order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and
14549 also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional
14550 inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last
14551 he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,
14552 the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.
14553 
14554 "A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once."
14555 
14556 "Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!"
14557 
14558 But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an
14559 ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more
14560 than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with
14561 swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their
14562 glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat
14563 and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,
14564 so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from
14565 the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped
14566 with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a
14567 waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a
14568 log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As
14569 when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
14570 mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
14571 spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying
14572 spout of the whale.
14573 
14574 Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
14575 showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
14576 Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at
14577 different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
14578 whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By
14579 very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was
14580 transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the
14581 stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially
14582 upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.
14583 
14584 It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the
14585 spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in
14586 his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as
14587 the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of
14588 captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no
14589 prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must
14590 needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully
14591 to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was
14592 the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from
14593 the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted
14594 that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'
14595 West Indian long before America was discovered.
14596 
14597 What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
14598 cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further
14599 discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over
14600 sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing
14601 tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of
14602 affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,
14603 indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if
14604 still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the
14605 command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
14606 strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables
14607 were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime
14608 everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of
14609 the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The
14610 ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks
14611 and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural
14612 dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon
14613 the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;
14614 and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could
14615 not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of
14616 ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on
14617 the point of going over.
14618 
14619 "Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" cried Stubb to the body, "don't be in
14620 such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do
14621 something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your
14622 handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and
14623 cut the big chains."
14624 
14625 "Knife?  Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy
14626 hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began
14627 slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of
14628 sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.
14629 With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,
14630 the carcase sank.
14631 
14632 Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
14633 Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
14634 accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
14635 buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
14636 surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
14637 broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
14638 bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert
14639 that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the
14640 fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in
14641 him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and
14642 swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm
14643 flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
14644 these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
14645 
14646 Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
14647 accident than any other species.  Where one of that sort go down,
14648 twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt
14649 imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the
14650 Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a
14651 ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there
14652 are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,
14653 the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the
14654 reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to
14655 a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A
14656 line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.  In the Shore
14657 Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right
14658 Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
14659 of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look
14660 for it when it shall have ascended again.
14661 
14662 It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard
14663 from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again
14664 lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a
14665 Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of
14666 its incredible power of swimming.  Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout
14667 is so similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is
14668 often mistaken for it.  And consequently Derick and all his host were
14669 now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute.  The Virgin crowding
14670 all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all
14671 disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.
14672 
14673 Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.

14678 
14679 The Honour and Glory of Whaling.
14680 
14681 
14682 There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
14683 true method.
14684 
14685 The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches
14686 up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with
14687 its great honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so
14688 many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way
14689 or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the
14690 reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so
14691 emblazoned a fraternity.
14692 
14693 The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
14694 the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale
14695 attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.
14696 Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore
14697 arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men's lamp-feeders.
14698 Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the
14699 lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the
14700 sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,
14701 Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the
14702 monster, and delivered and married the maid.  It was an admirable
14703 artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the
14704 present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first
14705 dart.  And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient
14706 Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,
14707 there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the
14708 city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical
14709 bones of the monster that Perseus slew.  When the Romans took Joppa,
14710 the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph.  What seems most
14711 singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was
14712 from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
14713 
14714 Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some
14715 supposed to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of
14716 St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a
14717 whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely
14718 jumbled together, and often stand for each other.  "Thou art as a
14719 lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea," saith Ezekiel;
14720 hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible
14721 use that word itself.  Besides, it would much subtract from the glory
14722 of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of
14723 the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.
14724 Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a
14725 Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.
14726 
14727 Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
14728 creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
14729 represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is
14730 depicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the
14731 great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was
14732 unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus' case, St.
14733 George's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and
14734 considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only
14735 a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not
14736 appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the
14737 ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no
14738 other than the great Leviathan himself.  In fact, placed before the
14739 strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish,
14740 flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being
14741 planted before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and both the palms
14742 of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of
14743 him remained.  Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a
14744 whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we
14745 harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
14746 of St. George.  And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable
14747 company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a
14748 whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with
14749 disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
14750 much better entitled to St. George's decoration than they.
14751 
14752 Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
14753 remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
14754 antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good
14755 deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether
14756 that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted.  It
14757 nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless,
14758 indeed, from the inside.  Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of
14759 involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not
14760 the whale.  I claim him for one of our clan.
14761 
14762 But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
14763 Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still
14764 more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa;
14765 certainly they are very similar.  If I claim the demigod then, why
14766 not the prophet?
14767 
14768 Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the
14769 whole roll of our order.  Our grand master is still to be named; for
14770 like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our
14771 fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves.  That
14772 wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster,
14773 which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the
14774 godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our
14775 Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations,
14776 has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.  When Brahma, or the
14777 God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after
14778 one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to
14779 preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose
14780 perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before
14781 beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
14782 something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
14783 Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
14784 incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost
14785 depths, rescued the sacred volumes.  Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman,
14786 then? even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?
14787 
14788 Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a
14789 member-roll for you!  What club but the whaleman's can head off like
14790 that?

14794 CHAPTER 83
14795 
14796 Jonah Historically Regarded.
14797 
14798 
14799 Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in
14800 the preceding chapter.  Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
14801 historical story of Jonah and the whale.  But then there were some
14802 sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox
14803 pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the
14804 whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those
14805 traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for
14806 all that.
14807 
14808 One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
14809 story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
14810 embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which
14811 represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity
14812 only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right
14813 Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the
14814 fishermen have this saying, "A penny roll would choke him"; his
14815 swallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative
14816 answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we
14817 consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily
14818 lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough
14819 in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would
14820 accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
14821 players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a
14822 hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.
14823 
14824 Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
14825 want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely
14826 in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.
14827 But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German
14828 exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating
14829 body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian
14830 campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.
14831 Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that
14832 when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway
14833 effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a
14834 whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called "The
14835 Whale," as some craft are nowadays christened the "Shark," the
14836 "Gull," the "Eagle."  Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists
14837 who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely
14838 meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag of wind--which the endangered
14839 prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.  Poor
14840 Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round.  But he had still
14841 another reason for his want of faith.  It was this, if I remember
14842 right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and
14843 after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'
14844 journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three
14845 days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean
14846 coast.  How is that?
14847 
14848 But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
14849 that short distance of Nineveh?  Yes.  He might have carried him
14850 round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not to speak of the
14851 passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another
14852 passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would
14853 involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days,
14854 not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being
14855 too shallow for any whale to swim in.  Besides, this idea of Jonah's
14856 weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the
14857 honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz,
14858 its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.
14859 
14860 But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
14861 foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him,
14862 seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up
14863 from the sun and the sea.  I say it only shows his foolish, impious
14864 pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend
14865 clergy.  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of
14866 Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a
14867 signal magnification of the general miracle.  And so it was.
14868 Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe
14869 in the historical story of Jonah.  And some three centuries ago, an
14870 English traveller in old Harris's Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque
14871 built in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that
14872 burnt without any oil.
14873 
14874 
14875 
14876 CHAPTER 84
14877 
14878 Pitchpoling.
14879 
14880 
14881 To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
14882 anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
14883 analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom.  Nor is
14884 it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may
14885 possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and
14886 water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object
14887 in view is to make the boat slide bravely.  Queequeg believed
14888 strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the
14889 German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in
14890 that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the
14891 side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to
14892 insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel.  He seemed to be
14893 working in obedience to some particular presentiment.  Nor did it
14894 remain unwarranted by the event.
14895 
14896 Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down
14897 to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
14898 flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium.
14899 
14900 Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost.  By great
14901 exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
14902 stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his
14903 horizontal flight, with added fleetness.  Such unintermitted
14904 strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably
14905 extract it.  It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be
14906 content to lose him.  But to haul the boat up to his flank was
14907 impossible, he swam so fast and furious.  What then remained?
14908 
14909 Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
14910 countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often
14911 forced, none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called
14912 pitchpoling.  Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises
14913 boasts nothing like it.  It is only indispensable with an inveterate
14914 running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance
14915 to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently
14916 rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.  Steel and wood
14917 included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the
14918 staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a
14919 lighter material--pine.  It is furnished with a small rope called a
14920 warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the
14921 hand after darting.
14922 
14923 But before going further, it is important to mention here, that
14924 though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance,
14925 yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently
14926 successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of
14927 the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become
14928 serious drawbacks.  As a general thing, therefore, you must first
14929 get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.
14930 
14931 Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness
14932 and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to
14933 excel in pitchpoling.  Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed
14934 bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is
14935 forty feet ahead.  Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or
14936 thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb
14937 whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to
14938 secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.
14939 Then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle, he levels
14940 it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses
14941 the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon
14942 stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air.  He
14943 minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.
14944 Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the
14945 bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot
14946 of the whale.  Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
14947 
14948 "That drove the spigot out of him!" cried Stubb.  "'Tis July's
14949 immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today!  Would now, it
14950 were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old
14951 Monongahela!  Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin to the
14952 jet, and we'd drink round it!  Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd brew
14953 choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that
14954 live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff."
14955 
14956 Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is
14957 repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in
14958 skilful leash.  The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line
14959 is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands,
14960 and mutely watches the monster die.
14961 
14962 
14963 
14964 CHAPTER 85
14965 
14966 The Fountain.
14967 
14968 
14969 That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of
14970 ages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the
14971 sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with
14972 so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries
14973 back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of
14974 the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this
14975 should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a
14976 quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of
14977 December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these
14978 spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is
14979 surely a noteworthy thing.
14980 
14981 Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
14982 contingent.  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
14983 gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times
14984 is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or
14985 a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
14986 surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
14987 regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by
14988 inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the
14989 necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he
14990 cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary
14991 attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet
14992 beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
14993 connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle
14994 alone; and this is on the top of his head.
14995 
14996 If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
14997 indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
14998 certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with
14999 the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not
15000 think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous
15001 scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in
15002 a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his
15003 nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to
15004 say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,
15005 this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,
15006 by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without
15007 drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle
15008 of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his
15009 ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
15010 involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,
15011 when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated
15012 blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,
15013 he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel
15014 crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for
15015 future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact
15016 of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded
15017 upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I
15018 consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in
15019 HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I
15020 mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale
15021 will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his
15022 other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets
15023 seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he
15024 rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,
15025 to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
15026 so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good
15027 his regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are
15028 told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.
15029 Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are
15030 different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale
15031 thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish
15032 his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,
15033 too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all
15034 the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could
15035 this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms
15036 beneath the sunlight.  Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the
15037 great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
15038 
15039 In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving
15040 for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has
15041 to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.
15042 But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his
15043 time.
15044 
15045 It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
15046 if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
15047 then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of
15048 smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at
15049 all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so
15050 clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power
15051 of smelling.  But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be
15052 water or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be
15053 arrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm
15054 Whale has no proper olfactories.  But what does he want of them?  No
15055 roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.
15056 
15057 Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his
15058 spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is
15059 furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
15060 retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the
15061 whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so
15062 strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what
15063 has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that
15064 had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out
15065 something by way of getting a living.  Oh! happy that the world is
15066 such an excellent listener!
15067 
15068 Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is
15069 for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
15070 horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a
15071 little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe
15072 laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question
15073 returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,
15074 whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled
15075 breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in
15076 at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain
15077 that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but
15078 it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
15079 through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing
15080 would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.
15081 But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he
15082 cannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very
15083 closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when
15084 unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his
15085 jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
15086 
15087 But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak
15088 out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can
15089 you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so
15090 easy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain
15091 things the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might
15092 almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
15093 
15094 The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist
15095 enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls
15096 from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a
15097 close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water
15098 cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that
15099 you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know
15100 that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know
15101 that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the
15102 spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the
15103 whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day
15104 sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in
15105 the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of
15106 water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a
15107 cavity in a rock filled up with rain.
15108 
15109 Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching
15110 the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be
15111 peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your
15112 pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even
15113 when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the
15114 jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from
15115 the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who
15116 coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some
15117 scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin
15118 peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the
15119 spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I
15120 have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is
15121 fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.  The wisest thing
15122 the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly
15123 spout alone.
15124 
15125 Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.  My
15126 hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist.  And besides
15127 other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
15128 touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;
15129 I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an
15130 undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;
15131 all other whales sometimes are.  He is both ponderous and profound.
15132 And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound
15133 beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,
15134 there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act
15135 of thinking deep thoughts.  While composing a little treatise on
15136 Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere
15137 long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation
15138 in the atmosphere over my head.  The invariable moisture of my hair,
15139 while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
15140 shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument
15141 for the above supposition.
15142 
15143 And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
15144 behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,
15145 mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his
15146 incommunicable contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes
15147 see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal
15148 upon his thoughts.  For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear
15149 air; they only irradiate vapour.  And so, through all the thick mists
15150 of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,
15151 enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.  And for this I thank God; for
15152 all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with
15153 them, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions
15154 of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor
15155 infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.
15156

15159 CHAPTER 86
15160 
15161 The Tail.
15162 
15163 
15164 Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
15165 and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less
15166 celestial, I celebrate a tail.
15167 
15168 Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point
15169 of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it
15170 comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty
15171 square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two
15172 broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less
15173 than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes
15174 slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,
15175 leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of
15176 beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of
15177 these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the
15178 tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.
15179 
15180 The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
15181 into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,
15182 middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are
15183 long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
15184 crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much
15185 as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old
15186 Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the
15187 thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those
15188 wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so
15189 much to the great strength of the masonry.
15190 
15191 But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not
15192 enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and
15193 woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side
15194 the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with
15195 them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the
15196 confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to
15197 a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to
15198 do it.
15199 
15200 Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the
15201 graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease
15202 undulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary, those
15203 motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.  Real strength
15204 never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in
15205 everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the
15206 magic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from
15207 the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.  As
15208 devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of
15209 Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that
15210 seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints even God the
15211 Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.  And whatever
15212 they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
15213 hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
15214 successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of
15215 all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,
15216 feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is
15217 conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.
15218 
15219 Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
15220 wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
15221 be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.
15222 Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.
15223 
15224 Five great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a fin for
15225 progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in
15226 sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
15227 
15228 First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in
15229 a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It
15230 never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.
15231 To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise
15232 coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,
15233 it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the
15234 monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer
15235 by.
15236 
15237 Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
15238 fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in
15239 his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.
15240 In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and
15241 the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the
15242 unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is
15243 then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.
15244 Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways
15245 through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy
15246 of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked
15247 rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is
15248 generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so
15249 often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's
15250 play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.
15251 
15252 Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
15253 the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
15254 there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
15255 elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
15256 sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
15257 slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of
15258 the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,
15259 whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary
15260 touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway
15261 bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the
15262 flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to
15263 damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a
15264 pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in
15265 his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded
15266 in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.
15267 
15268 Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of
15269 the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast
15270 corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as
15271 if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The
15272 broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting
15273 the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would
15274 almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the
15275 light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you
15276 would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.
15277 
15278 Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the
15279 flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then
15280 completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to
15281 plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of
15282 his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a
15283 moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime
15284 BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's
15285 flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated
15286 nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems
15287 spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I
15288 seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from
15289 the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in
15290 all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to
15291 you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head
15292 of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a
15293 large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and
15294 for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed
15295 to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods
15296 was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.
15297 As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then
15298 testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all
15299 beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of
15300 antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
15301 profoundest silence.
15302 
15303 The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
15304 elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
15305 of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two
15306 opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
15307 respectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier
15308 to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but
15309 the stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk
15310 were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush
15311 and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated
15312 instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their
15313 oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses
15314 his balls.*
15315 
15316 
15317 *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
15318 and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
15319 elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does
15320 to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
15321 curious similitude; among these is the spout.  It is well known that
15322 the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then
15323 elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.
15324 
15325 
15326 The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my
15327 inability to express it.  At times there are gestures in it, which,
15328 though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
15329 inexplicable.  In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
15330 these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared
15331 them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by
15332 these methods intelligently conversed with the world.  Nor are there
15333 wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of
15334 strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.
15335 Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not,
15336 and never will.  But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how
15337 understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he
15338 has none?  Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,
15339 but my face shall not be seen.  But I cannot completely make out his
15340 back parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has
15341 no face.
15342 
15343 
15344 
15345 CHAPTER 87
15346 
15347 The Grand Armada.
15348 
15349 
15350 The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward
15351 from the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all
15352 Asia.  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long
15353 islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others,
15354 form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with
15355 Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the
15356 thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.  This rampart is pierced by
15357 several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;
15358 conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca.  By the
15359 straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west,
15360 emerge into the China seas.
15361 
15362 Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
15363 midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
15364 promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little
15365 correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled
15366 empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and
15367 silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand
15368 islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant
15369 provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of
15370 the land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual,
15371 of being guarded from the all-grasping western world.  The shores of
15372 the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses
15373 which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the
15374 Propontis.  Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the
15375 obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of
15376 ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day,
15377 have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with
15378 the costliest cargoes of the east.  But while they freely waive a
15379 ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to
15380 more solid tribute.
15381 
15382 Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the
15383 low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
15384 vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at
15385 the point of their spears.  Though by the repeated bloody
15386 chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers,
15387 the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;
15388 yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and
15389 American vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly
15390 boarded and pillaged.
15391 
15392 With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
15393 straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
15394 thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here
15395 and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine
15396 Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great
15397 whaling season there.  By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod
15398 would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the
15399 world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where
15400 Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted
15401 upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to
15402 frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed
15403 to be haunting it.
15404 
15405 But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his
15406 crew drink air?  Surely, he will stop for water.  Nay.  For a long
15407 time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring,
15408 and needs no sustenance but what's in himself.  So Ahab.  Mark this,
15409 too, in the whaler.  While other hulls are loaded down with alien
15410 stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering
15411 whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and
15412 their wants.  She has a whole lake's contents bottled in her ample
15413 hold.  She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable
15414 pig-lead and kentledge.  She carries years' water in her.  Clear old
15415 prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the
15416 Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish
15417 fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian
15418 streams.  Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China
15419 from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the
15420 whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of
15421 soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
15422 themselves.  So that did you carry them the news that another flood
15423 had come; they would only answer--"Well, boys, here's the ark!"
15424 
15425 Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
15426 Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most
15427 of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen
15428 as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained
15429 more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed,
15430 and admonished to keep wide awake.  But though the green palmy cliffs
15431 of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted
15432 nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single
15433 jet was descried.  Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with
15434 any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when
15435 the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a
15436 spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.
15437 
15438 But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
15439 which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm
15440 Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
15441 companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in
15442 extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it
15443 would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn
15444 league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.  To this
15445 aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be
15446 imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you
15447 may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being
15448 greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what
15449 sometimes seems thousands on thousands.
15450 
15451 Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
15452 forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,
15453 a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
15454 noon-day air.  Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the
15455 Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like
15456 the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting
15457 spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,
15458 continually rising and falling away to leeward.
15459 
15460 Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill
15461 of the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into
15462 the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,
15463 showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis,
15464 descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
15465 
15466 As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
15467 accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage
15468 in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
15469 plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying
15470 forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
15471 semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic
15472 centre.
15473 
15474 Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
15475 handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their
15476 yet suspended boats.  If the wind only held, little doubt had they,
15477 that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only
15478 deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of
15479 their number.  And who could tell whether, in that congregated
15480 caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like
15481 the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the
15482 Siamese!  So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,
15483 driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of
15484 Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our
15485 wake.
15486 
15487 Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our
15488 rear.  It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling
15489 something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so
15490 completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
15491 disappearing.  Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly
15492 revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, "Aloft there, and rig whips and
15493 buckets to wet the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!"
15494 
15495 As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
15496 fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in
15497 hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.  But when the
15498 swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase;
15499 how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding
15500 her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to
15501 her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced
15502 the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and
15503 in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such
15504 fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green
15505 walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and
15506 bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,
15507 and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing
15508 and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of
15509 remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were
15510 infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these
15511 conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and
15512 ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been
15513 gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.
15514 
15515 But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
15516 when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
15517 Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
15518 side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
15519 harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been
15520 gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
15521 victoriously gained upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the
15522 wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed;
15523 gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was
15524 passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some
15525 presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of
15526 the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their
15527 rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
15528 battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of
15529 stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
15530 
15531 Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
15532 after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
15533 chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave
15534 animating token that they were now at last under the influence of
15535 that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the
15536 fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The
15537 compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and
15538 steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and
15539 like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they
15540 seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in
15541 vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by
15542 their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction
15543 of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their
15544 number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like
15545 water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been
15546 but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce
15547 wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.
15548 But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding
15549 creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the
15550 lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary
15551 horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together
15552 in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest
15553 alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
15554 trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.
15555 Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied
15556 whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth
15557 which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
15558 
15559 Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
15560 yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced
15561 nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is
15562 customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making
15563 for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about
15564 three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish
15565 darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like
15566 light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a
15567 movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is
15568 in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less
15569 anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous
15570 vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you
15571 deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to
15572 circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.
15573 
15574 As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power
15575 of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;
15576 as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we
15577 flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset
15578 boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving
15579 to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at
15580 what moment it may be locked in and crushed.
15581 
15582 But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
15583 from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging
15584 away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while
15585 all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking
15586 out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for
15587 there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite
15588 idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.
15589 They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  "Out of
15590 the way, Commodore!" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden
15591 rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp
15592 us.  "Hard down with your tail, there!" cried a second to another,
15593 which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his
15594 own fan-like extremity.
15595 
15596 All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally
15597 invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares
15598 of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they
15599 cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable
15600 length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other
15601 end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a
15602 harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.
15603 For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly
15604 chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;
15605 while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot
15606 kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
15607 afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like
15608 these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with
15609 three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we
15610 saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous
15611 sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like
15612 malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in
15613 the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under
15614 one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and
15615 carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the
15616 seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the
15617 wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,
15618 and so stopped the leaks for the time.
15619 
15620 It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were
15621 it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly
15622 diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
15623 the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.
15624 So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing
15625 whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
15626 momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of
15627 the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
15628 valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the
15629 outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse
15630 the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,
15631 produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more
15632 quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say
15633 lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted
15634 distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and
15635 saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going
15636 round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so
15637 closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might
15638 easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on
15639 their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,
15640 more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no
15641 possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch
15642 for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had
15643 only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of
15644 the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;
15645 the women and children of this routed host.
15646 
15647 Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
15648 outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods
15649 in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,
15650 embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or
15651 three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a
15652 time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low
15653 boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I
15654 mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had
15655 been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide
15656 extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the
15657 precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,
15658 unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it
15659 may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our
15660 becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous
15661 fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it
15662 was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came
15663 snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till
15664 it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.
15665 Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with
15666 his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained
15667 from darting it.
15668 
15669 But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and
15670 still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,
15671 suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing
15672 mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed
15673 shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a
15674 considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants
15675 while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as
15676 if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing
15677 mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly
15678 reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up
15679 towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in
15680 their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also
15681 seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from
15682 certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured
15683 some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a
15684 little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered
15685 from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
15686 reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,
15687 the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow.  The delicate
15688 side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the
15689 plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from
15690 foreign parts.
15691 
15692 "Line! line!" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; "him fast!
15693 him fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one
15694 little!"
15695 
15696 "What ails ye, man?" cried Starbuck.
15697 
15698 "Look-e here," said Queequeg, pointing down.
15699 
15700 As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds
15701 of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
15702 shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
15703 towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical
15704 cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still
15705 tethered to its dam.  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the
15706 chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes
15707 entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.
15708 Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in
15709 this enchanted pond.  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*
15710 
15711 
15712 *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but
15713 unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
15714 gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing
15715 but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to
15716 an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two
15717 teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the
15718 breasts themselves extend upwards from that.  When by chance these
15719 precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the
15720 mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for
15721 rods.  The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it
15722 might do well with strawberries.  When overflowing with mutual
15723 esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.
15724 
15725 
15726 And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
15727 and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely
15728 and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely
15729 revelled in dalliance and delight.  But even so, amid the tornadoed
15730 Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in
15731 mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round
15732 me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal
15733 mildness of joy.
15734 
15735 Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
15736 spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
15737 still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
15738 possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
15739 of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them.  But the
15740 sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to
15741 and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.
15742 It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly
15743 powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by
15744 sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon.  It is done by darting
15745 a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for
15746 hauling it back again.  A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in
15747 this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from
15748 the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in
15749 the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the
15750 revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
15751 battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.
15752 
15753 But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
15754 spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he
15755 seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at
15756 first the intervening distance obscured from us.  But at length we
15757 perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,
15758 this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he
15759 had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free
15760 end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in
15761 the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade
15762 itself had worked loose from his flesh.  So that tormented to
15763 madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing
15764 with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
15765 wounding and murdering his own comrades.
15766 
15767 This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
15768 stationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
15769 began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted
15770 by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly
15771 to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries
15772 vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more
15773 central circles began to swim in thickening clusters.  Yes, the long
15774 calm was departing.  A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then
15775 like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river
15776 Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling
15777 upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common
15778 mountain.  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
15779 taking the stern.
15780 
15781 "Oars!  Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--"gripe your
15782 oars, and clutch your souls, now!  My God, men, stand by!  Shove him
15783 off, you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him!  Stand
15784 up--stand up, and stay so!  Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their
15785 backs--scrape them!--scrape away!"
15786 
15787 The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving
15788 a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths.  But by desperate
15789 endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
15790 rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
15791 After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided
15792 into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by
15793 random whales, all violently making for one centre.  This lucky
15794 salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who,
15795 while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat
15796 taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing
15797 of a pair of broad flukes close by.
15798 
15799 Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
15800 resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
15801 clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
15802 onward flight with augmented fleetness.  Further pursuit was useless;
15803 but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
15804 whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which
15805 Flask had killed and waifed.  The waif is a pennoned pole, two or
15806 three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional
15807 game is at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a
15808 dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of
15809 prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.
15810 
15811 The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that
15812 sagacious saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish.  Of
15813 all the drugged whales only one was captured.  The rest contrived to
15814 escape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen,
15815 by some other craft than the Pequod.
15816 
15817 
15818 
15819 CHAPTER 88
15820 
15821 Schools and Schoolmasters.
15822 
15823 
15824 The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
15825 Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing
15826 those vast aggregations.
15827 
15828 Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
15829 have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
15830 occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals
15831 each.  Such bands are known as schools.  They generally are of two
15832 sorts; those composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering
15833 none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly
15834 designated.
15835 
15836 In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see
15837 a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm,
15838 evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight
15839 of his ladies.  In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,
15840 swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by
15841 all the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast between
15842 this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is
15843 always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at
15844 full growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an
15845 average-sized male.  They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare
15846 say, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist.  Nevertheless,
15847 it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily
15848 entitled to EMBONPOINT.
15849 
15850 It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
15851 ramblings.  Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in
15852 leisurely search of variety.  You meet them on the Line in time for
15853 the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just
15854 returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and
15855 so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth.  By the
15856 time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator
15857 awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the
15858 cool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of
15859 the year.
15860 
15861 When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
15862 suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
15863 interesting family.  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan
15864 coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the
15865 ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases
15866 him away!  High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him
15867 are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though
15868 do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario
15869 out of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common.  As ashore, the
15870 ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival
15871 admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly
15872 battle, and all for love.  They fence with their long lower jaws,
15873 sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy
15874 like elks that warringly interweave their antlers.  Not a few are
15875 captured having the deep scars of these encounters,--furrowed heads,
15876 broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and
15877 dislocated mouths.
15878 
15879 But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
15880 the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very diverting to
15881 watch that lord.  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again
15882 and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young
15883 Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand
15884 concubines.  Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen
15885 will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand
15886 Turks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness
15887 is small.  As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons
15888 and daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the
15889 maternal help.  For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that
15890 might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however
15891 much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his
15892 anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic.  In good
15893 time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and
15894 dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a
15895 general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and
15896 virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the
15897 impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands
15898 the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all
15899 alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and
15900 warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.
15901 
15902 Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so
15903 is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
15904 schoolmaster.  It is therefore not in strict character, however
15905 admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should
15906 then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly
15907 of it.  His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived
15908 from the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised
15909 that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must
15910 have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a
15911 country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days,
15912 and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into
15913 some of his pupils.
15914 
15915 The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
15916 betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
15917 Whales.  Almost universally, a lone whale--as a solitary Leviathan is
15918 called--proves an ancient one.  Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel
15919 Boone, he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he
15920 takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she
15921 is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.
15922 
15923 The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
15924 mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.  For while
15925 those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
15926 forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
15927 of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
15928 excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
15929 and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal
15930 gout.
15931 
15932 The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.
15933 Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and
15934 wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking
15935 rate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he
15936 would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.  They soon relinquish this
15937 turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and
15938 separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.
15939 
15940 Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
15941 still more characteristic of the sexes.  Say you strike a
15942 Forty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him.  But strike
15943 a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
15944 every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long,
15945 as themselves to fall a prey.

15949 CHAPTER 89
15950 
15951 Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.
15952 
15953 
15954 The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
15955 necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
15956 fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
15957 
15958 It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in
15959 company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be
15960 finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are
15961 indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this
15962 one grand feature.  For example,--after a weary and perilous chase
15963 and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by
15964 reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be
15965 retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside,
15966 without risk of life or line.  Thus the most vexatious and violent
15967 disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some
15968 written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all
15969 cases.
15970 
15971 Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
15972 enactment, was that of Holland.  It was decreed by the States-General
15973 in A.D. 1695.  But though no other nation has ever had any written
15974 whaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their own
15975 legislators and lawyers in this matter.  They have provided a system
15976 which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and
15977 the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling
15978 with other People's Business.  Yes; these laws might be engraven on a
15979 Queen Anne's forthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the
15980 neck, so small are they.
15981 
15982 I.  A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
15983 
15984 II.  A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
15985 
15986 But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
15987 brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
15988 expound it.
15989 
15990 First: What is a Fast-Fish?  Alive or dead a fish is technically
15991 fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any
15992 medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a mast, an
15993 oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it
15994 is all the same.  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a
15995 waif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the
15996 party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it
15997 alongside, as well as their intention so to do.
15998 
15999 These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the
16000 whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder
16001 knocks--the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist.  True, among the more
16002 upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for
16003 peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for
16004 one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed
16005 by another party.  But others are by no means so scrupulous.
16006 
16007 Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover
16008 litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a
16009 hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the
16010 plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last,
16011 through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their
16012 lines, but their boat itself.  Ultimately the defendants (the crew of
16013 another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and
16014 finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.  And
16015 when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped
16016 his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of
16017 doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line,
16018 harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at the
16019 time of the seizure.  Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the
16020 recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.
16021 
16022 Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
16023 judge.  In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
16024 illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
16025 wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's
16026 viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
16027 the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action
16028 to recover possession of her.  Erskine was on the other side; and he
16029 then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
16030 harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
16031 the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned
16032 her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
16033 therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then
16034 became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever
16035 harpoon might have been found sticking in her.
16036 
16037 Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the
16038 whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
16039 
16040 These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the
16041 very learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the
16042 boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely
16043 abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the
16044 controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the
16045 defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the
16046 final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made
16047 off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles;
16048 and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.
16049 Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid
16050 articles were theirs.
16051 
16052 A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge,
16053 might possibly object to it.  But ploughed up to the primary rock of
16054 the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling
16055 laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord
16056 Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching
16057 Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the
16058 fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its
16059 complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the
16060 Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.
16061 
16062 Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the
16063 law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?  But
16064 often possession is the whole of the law.  What are the sinews and
16065 souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof
16066 possession is the whole of the law?  What to the rapacious landlord
16067 is the widow's last mite but a Fast-Fish?  What is yonder undetected
16068 villain's marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that
16069 but a Fast-Fish?  What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the
16070 broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to
16071 keep Woebegone's family from starvation; what is that ruinous
16072 discount but a Fast-Fish?  What is the Archbishop of Savesoul's
16073 income of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of
16074 hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
16075 without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular L100,000 but a
16076 Fast-Fish?  What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns and
16077 hamlets but Fast-Fish?  What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull,
16078 is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish?  What to that apostolic lancer,
16079 Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish?  And concerning all
16080 these, is not Possession the whole of the law?
16081 
16082 But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
16083 kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so.  That is
16084 internationally and universally applicable.
16085 
16086 What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck
16087 the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and
16088 mistress?  What was Poland to the Czar?  What Greece to the Turk?
16089 What India to England?  What at last will Mexico be to the United
16090 States?  All Loose-Fish.
16091 
16092 What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
16093 Loose-Fish?  What all men's minds and opinions but Loose-Fish?  What
16094 is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish?  What
16095 to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers
16096 but Loose-Fish?  What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish?
16097 And what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?

16103 Heads or Tails.
16104 
16105 
16106 "De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam."
16107 BRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.
16108 
16109 
16110 Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with
16111 the context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the
16112 coast of that land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have
16113 the head, and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail.  A
16114 division which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is
16115 no intermediate remainder.  Now as this law, under a modified form,
16116 is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in various
16117 respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and
16118 Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same
16119 courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the
16120 expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation
16121 of royalty.  In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that
16122 the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before
16123 you a circumstance that happened within the last two years.
16124 
16125 It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
16126 of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
16127 beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off
16128 from the shore.  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under
16129 the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord
16130 Warden.  Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all
16131 the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become
16132 by assignment his.  By some writers this office is called a sinecure.
16133 But not so.  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in
16134 fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same
16135 fobbing of them.
16136 
16137 Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
16138 trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
16139 fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the
16140 precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their
16141 wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their
16142 respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
16143 charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and
16144 laying it upon the whale's head, he says--"Hands off! this fish, my
16145 masters, is a Fast-Fish.  I seize it as the Lord Warden's."  Upon
16146 this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation--so truly
16147 English--knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their
16148 heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
16149 stranger.  But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften
16150 the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone.
16151 At length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas,
16152 made bold to speak,
16153 
16154 "Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"
16155 
16156 "The Duke."
16157 
16158 "But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"
16159 
16160 "It is his."
16161 
16162 "We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is
16163 all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing at all for
16164 our pains but our blisters?"
16165 
16166 "It is his."
16167 
16168 "Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
16169 getting a livelihood?"
16170 
16171 "It is his."
16172 
16173 "I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
16174 this whale."
16175 
16176 "It is his."
16177 
16178 "Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?"
16179 
16180 "It is his."
16181 
16182 In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
16183 Wellington received the money.  Thinking that viewed in some
16184 particular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small
16185 degree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an
16186 honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his
16187 Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners
16188 into full consideration.  To which my Lord Duke in substance replied
16189 (both letters were published) that he had already done so, and
16190 received the money, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if
16191 for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling
16192 with other people's business.  Is this the still militant old man,
16193 standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing
16194 alms of beggars?
16195 
16196 It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
16197 Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign.  We must
16198 needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally
16199 invested with that right.  The law itself has already been set forth.
16200 But Plowdon gives us the reason for it.  Says Plowdon, the whale so
16201 caught belongs to the King and Queen, "because of its superior
16202 excellence."  And by the soundest commentators this has ever been
16203 held a cogent argument in such matters.
16204 
16205 But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?  A
16206 reason for that, ye lawyers!
16207 
16208 In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's
16209 Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: "Ye tail is ye
16210 Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone."
16211 Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the
16212 Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices.  But
16213 this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad
16214 mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.  But is the Queen a
16215 mermaid, to be presented with a tail?  An allegorical meaning may
16216 lurk here.
16217 
16218 There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--the
16219 whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain
16220 limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's
16221 ordinary revenue.  I know not that any other author has hinted of the
16222 matter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be
16223 divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly
16224 dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically
16225 regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed
16226 congeniality.  And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in
16227 law.
16228

16231 CHAPTER 91
16232 
16233 The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
16234 
16235 
16236 "In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this
16237 Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry."
16238 SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.
16239 
16240 
16241 It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
16242 we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the
16243 many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
16244 the three pairs of eyes aloft.  A peculiar and not very pleasant
16245 smell was smelt in the sea.
16246 
16247 "I will bet something now," said Stubb, "that somewhere hereabouts
16248 are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day.  I thought
16249 they would keel up before long."
16250 
16251 Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the
16252 distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of
16253 whale must be alongside.  As we glided nearer, the stranger showed
16254 French colours from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture
16255 sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was
16256 plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a
16257 blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea,
16258 and so floated an unappropriated corpse.  It may well be conceived,
16259 what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian
16260 city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the
16261 departed.  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no
16262 cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.  Yet are there
16263 those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil
16264 obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no
16265 means of the nature of attar-of-rose.
16266 
16267 Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the
16268 Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed
16269 even more of a nosegay than the first.  In truth, it turned out to be
16270 one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a
16271 sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct
16272 bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.  Nevertheless,
16273 in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever
16274 turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun
16275 blasted whales in general.
16276 
16277 The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
16278 recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
16279 knotted round the tail of one of these whales.
16280 
16281 "There's a pretty fellow, now," he banteringly laughed, standing in
16282 the ship's bows, "there's a jackal for ye!  I well know that these
16283 Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes
16284 lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale
16285 spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold
16286 full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing
16287 that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's
16288 wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here's a
16289 Crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I
16290 mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that
16291 other precious fish he has there.  Poor devil!  I say, pass round a
16292 hat, some one, and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear
16293 charity's sake.  For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale
16294 there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned
16295 cell.  And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by
16296 chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he'll get
16297 from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may
16298 contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris.  I
16299 wonder now if our old man has thought of that.  It's worth trying.
16300 Yes, I'm for it;" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.
16301 
16302 By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that
16303 whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with
16304 no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.  Issuing from
16305 the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the
16306 stranger.  Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance
16307 with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was
16308 carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green,
16309 and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there;
16310 the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red
16311 colour.  Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read "Bouton
16312 de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name
16313 of this aromatic ship.
16314 
16315 Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription,
16316 yet the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together,
16317 sufficiently explained the whole to him.
16318 
16319 "A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried with his hand to his nose, "that
16320 will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!"
16321 
16322 Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
16323 had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close
16324 to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.
16325 
16326 Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
16327 bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses
16328 that speak English?"
16329 
16330 "Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to
16331 be the chief-mate.
16332 
16333 "Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?"
16334 
16335 "WHAT whale?"
16336 
16337 "The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
16338 
16339 "Never heard of such a whale.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no."
16340 
16341 "Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."
16342 
16343 Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
16344 over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
16345 hands into a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir!  No!"  Upon which Ahab
16346 retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
16347 
16348 He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
16349 chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort
16350 of bag.
16351 
16352 "What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb.  "Broke it?"
16353 
16354 "I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!"
16355 answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was
16356 at very much.  "But what are you holding YOURS for?"
16357 
16358 "Oh, nothing!  It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on.  Fine day,
16359 ain't it?  Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of
16360 posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"
16361 
16362 "What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the Guernseyman,
16363 flying into a sudden passion.
16364 
16365 "Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those
16366 whales in ice while you're working at 'em?  But joking aside, though;
16367 do you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil
16368 out of such whales?  As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a
16369 gill in his whole carcase."
16370 
16371 "I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't
16372 believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer
16373 before.  But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't
16374 me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape."
16375 
16376 "Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined
16377 Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.  There a queer
16378 scene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red
16379 worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.
16380 But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in
16381 anything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from
16382 their faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would
16383 drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.
16384 Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,
16385 and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the
16386 stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously
16387 puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their
16388 olfactories.
16389 
16390 Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding
16391 from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction
16392 saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar
16393 from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
16394 remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself
16395 to the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the
16396 pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
16397 indignations at times.
16398 
16399 Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to
16400 the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the
16401 stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited
16402 ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable
16403 a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the
16404 Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the
16405 ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise
16406 was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly
16407 concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the
16408 Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.
16409 According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under
16410 cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he
16411 pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter
16412 any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.
16413 
16414 By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a
16415 small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,
16416 with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton
16417 velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb
16418 was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once
16419 ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.
16420 
16421 "What shall I say to him first?" said he.
16422 
16423 "Why," said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,
16424 "you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish
16425 to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge."
16426 
16427 "He says, Monsieur," said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
16428 captain, "that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
16429 and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from
16430 a blasted whale they had brought alongside."
16431 
16432 Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
16433 
16434 "What now?" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
16435 
16436 "Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
16437 carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a
16438 whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a
16439 baboon."
16440 
16441 "He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,
16442 is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he
16443 conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."
16444 
16445 Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
16446 crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast
16447 loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
16448 
16449 "What now?" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
16450 them.
16451 
16452 "Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in
16453 fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps
16454 somebody else."
16455 
16456 "He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service
16457 to us."
16458 
16459 Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
16460 (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down
16461 into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
16462 
16463 "He wants you to take a glass of wine with him," said the
16464 interpreter.
16465 
16466 "Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink
16467 with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go."
16468 
16469 "He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;
16470 but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then
16471 Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from
16472 these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift."
16473 
16474 By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,
16475 hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line
16476 in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out
16477 the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the
16478 Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,
16479 Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,
16480 ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.
16481 
16482 Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the
16483 whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,
16484 while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon
16485 Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to
16486 give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of
16487 his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced
16488 an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would
16489 almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and
16490 when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like
16491 turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.
16492 His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their
16493 chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.
16494 
16495 And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
16496 screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was
16497 beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay
16498 increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,
16499 there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide
16500 of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow
16501 into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for
16502 a time.
16503 
16504 "I have it, I have it," cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
16505 in the subterranean regions, "a purse! a purse!"
16506 
16507 Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
16508 something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
16509 cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it
16510 with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And
16511 this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
16512 druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably
16513 lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured
16514 were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and
16515 come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.
16516 
16517 
16518 
16519 CHAPTER 92
16520 
16521 Ambergris.
16522 
16523 
16524 Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as
16525 an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
16526 Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on
16527 that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively
16528 late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber
16529 itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but
16530 the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite
16531 distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also
16532 dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found
16533 except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,
16534 odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and
16535 ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and
16536 spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious
16537 candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and
16538 also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is
16539 carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few
16540 grains into claret, to flavor it.
16541 
16542 Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
16543 regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a
16544 sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the
16545 cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How
16546 to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
16547 three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out
16548 of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.
16549 
16550 I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
16551 certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might
16552 be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they
16553 were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that
16554 manner.
16555 
16556 Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
16557 found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of
16558 that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and
16559 incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.
16560 And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is
16561 that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of
16562 all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental
16563 manufacturing stages, is the worst.
16564 
16565 I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
16566 cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
16567 whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,
16568 might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said
16569 of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the
16570 slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling
16571 is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another
16572 thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how
16573 did this odious stigma originate?
16574 
16575 I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
16576 Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.
16577 Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their
16578 oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the
16579 fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of
16580 large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the
16581 season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which
16582 they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,
16583 that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale
16584 cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat
16585 similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for
16586 the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.
16587 
16588 I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
16589 likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in
16590 former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,
16591 which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in
16592 his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name
16593 imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in
16594 order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to
16595 be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.
16596 It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when
16597 the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very
16598 pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea
16599 Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after
16600 completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume
16601 fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it
16602 is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or
16603 dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means
16604 creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people
16605 of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the
16606 nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,
16607 when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking
16608 abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,
16609 seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's
16610 flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady
16611 rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the
16612 Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not
16613 be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with
16614 myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander
16615 the Great?
16616 
16617 
16618 
16619 CHAPTER 93
16620 
16621 The Castaway.
16622 
16623 
16624 It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a
16625 most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's
16626 crew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the
16627 sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever
16628 accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her
16629 own.
16630 
16631 Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
16632 Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
16633 to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale.  As a
16634 general thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men
16635 comprising the boats' crews.  But if there happen to be an unduly
16636 slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain
16637 to be made a ship-keeper.  It was so in the Pequod with the little
16638 negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation.  Poor Pip! ye have
16639 heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic
16640 midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
16641 
16642 In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony
16643 and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour,
16644 driven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by
16645 nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over
16646 tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,
16647 genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever
16648 enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any
16649 other race.  For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but
16650 three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days.
16651 Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for
16652 even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,
16653 panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's
16654 peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he
16655 had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred
16656 his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus
16657 temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly
16658 illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to
16659 ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County
16660 in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the
16661 green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the
16662 round horizon into one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the
16663 clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
16664 pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
16665 jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he
16666 lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the
16667 sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery
16668 effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once
16669 the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel
16670 stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.
16671 
16672 It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman
16673 chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
16674 and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
16675 
16676 The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
16677 but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
16678 therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb
16679 observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his
16680 courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
16681 
16682 Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
16683 the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
16684 happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The
16685 involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
16686 hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack
16687 whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with
16688 him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the
16689 water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the
16690 line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up
16691 to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,
16692 which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.
16693 
16694 Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He
16695 hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,
16696 he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
16697 exclaimed interrogatively, "Cut?"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face
16698 plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less
16699 than half a minute, this entire thing happened.
16700 
16701 "Damn him, cut!" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
16702 saved.
16703 
16704 So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed
16705 by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these
16706 irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,
16707 business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;
16708 and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The
16709 substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest
16710 was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,
16711 STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will
16712 sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,
16713 as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted
16714 conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
16715 margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,
16716 and concluded with a peremptory command, "Stick to the boat, Pip, or
16717 by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't
16718 afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for
16719 thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and
16720 don't jump any more."  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that
16721 though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which
16722 propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.
16723 
16724 But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It
16725 was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but
16726 this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale
16727 started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried
16728 traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It
16729 was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and
16730 cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like
16731 gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and
16732 down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No
16733 boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's
16734 inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In
16735 three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and
16736 Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,
16737 curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the
16738 loftiest and the brightest.
16739 
16740 Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
16741 practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the
16742 awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self
16743 in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?
16744 Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark
16745 how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
16746 
16747 But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?
16748 No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in
16749 his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come
16750 up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such
16751 considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own
16752 timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar
16753 instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost
16754 invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the
16755 same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.
16756 
16757 But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
16758 spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
16759 Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
16760 upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him
16761 miserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
16762 but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;
16763 such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his
16764 finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned
16765 entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,
16766 where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro
16767 before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his
16768 hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile
16769 eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral
16770 insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal
16771 orbs.  He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;
16772 and therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man's insanity is
16773 heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at
16774 last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and
16775 frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as
16776 his God.
16777 
16778 For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly.  The thing is common in
16779 that fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be
16780 seen what like abandonment befell myself.
16781 
16782 
16783 
16784 CHAPTER 94
16785 
16786 A Squeeze of the Hand.
16787 
16788 
16789 That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
16790 Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
16791 previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling
16792 of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
16793 
16794 While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed
16795 in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm;
16796 and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully
16797 manipulated ere going to the try-works, of which anon.
16798 
16799 It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
16800 several others, I sat down before a large Constantine's bath of it, I
16801 found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about
16802 in the liquid part.  It was our business to squeeze these lumps back
16803 into fluid.  A sweet and unctuous duty!  No wonder that in old times
16804 this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic.  Such a clearer! such a
16805 sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier!  After
16806 having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like
16807 eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralise.
16808 
16809 As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
16810 exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
16811 indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands
16812 among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven
16813 almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and
16814 discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as
16815 I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,--literally and truly, like
16816 the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I
16817 lived as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in
16818 that inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I
16819 almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is
16820 of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that
16821 bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or
16822 malice, of any sort whatsoever.
16823 
16824 Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that
16825 sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till
16826 a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself
16827 unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their
16828 hands for the gentle globules.  Such an abounding, affectionate,
16829 friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was
16830 continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes
16831 sentimentally; as much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why
16832 should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest
16833 ill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us
16834 all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves
16835 universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.
16836 
16837 Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever!  For now,
16838 since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that
16839 in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his
16840 conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the
16841 intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the
16842 table, the saddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have
16843 perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally.  In
16844 thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in
16845 paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.
16846 
16847 Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
16848 akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
16849 try-works.
16850 
16851 First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the
16852 tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his
16853 flukes.  It is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but
16854 still contains some oil.  After being severed from the whale, the
16855 white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the
16856 mincer.  They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.
16857 
16858 Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of
16859 the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber,
16860 and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness.
16861 It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold.  As
16862 its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a
16863 bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest
16864 crimson and purple.  It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron.
16865 Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.  I
16866 confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it.  It tasted
16867 something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis
16868 le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the
16869 first day after the venison season, and that particular venison
16870 season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards
16871 of Champagne.
16872 
16873 There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up
16874 in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very
16875 puzzling adequately to describe.  It is called slobgollion; an
16876 appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of
16877 the substance.  It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most
16878 frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing,
16879 and subsequent decanting.  I hold it to be the wondrously thin,
16880 ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.
16881 
16882 Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
16883 sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.  It designates
16884 the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the
16885 Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those
16886 inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
16887 
16888 Nippers.  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's
16889 vocabulary.  But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so.  A whaleman's
16890 nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
16891 part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for
16892 the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe.  Edgewise
16893 moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and
16894 by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all
16895 impurities.
16896 
16897 But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at
16898 once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its
16899 inmates.  This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle
16900 for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale.  When
16901 the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment
16902 is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night.  On one side,
16903 lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.
16904 They generally go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man.
16905 The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the
16906 same name.  The gaff is something like a boat-hook.  With his gaff,
16907 the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it
16908 from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about.  Meanwhile, the
16909 spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it
16910 into the portable horse-pieces.  This spade is sharp as hone can make
16911 it; the spademan's feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will
16912 sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.  If he
16913 cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be
16914 very much astonished?  Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room
16915 men.
16916 
16917 
16918 
16919 CHAPTER 95
16920 
16921 The Cassock.
16922 
16923 
16924 Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
16925 post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
16926 windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
16927 curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have
16928 seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers.  Not the
16929 wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy of his
16930 unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of
16931 these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable
16932 cone,--longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at
16933 the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.  And an
16934 idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was.
16935 Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in
16936 Judea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her,
16937 and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook
16938 Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of
16939 Kings.
16940 
16941 Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
16942 assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the
16943 mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as
16944 if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.
16945 Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically
16946 to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.
16947 This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives
16948 it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at
16949 last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry.  Ere long, it is
16950 taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed
16951 extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end,
16952 he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.  The mincer now stands
16953 before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.
16954 Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately
16955 protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.
16956 
16957 That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
16958 pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
16959 planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub
16960 beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets
16961 from a rapt orator's desk.  Arrayed in decent black; occupying a
16962 conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an
16963 archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*
16964 
16965 
16966 *Bible leaves!  Bible leaves!  This is the invariable cry from the
16967 mates to the mincer.  It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work
16968 into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business
16969 of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity
16970 considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.
16971 
16972 
16973 
16974 CHAPTER 96
16975 
16976 The Try-Works.
16977 
16978 
16979 Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
16980 distinguished by her try-works.  She presents the curious anomaly of
16981 the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
16982 completed ship.  It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were
16983 transported to her planks.
16984 
16985 The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the
16986 most roomy part of the deck.  The timbers beneath are of a peculiar
16987 strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of
16988 brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height.
16989 The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
16990 secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
16991 sides, and screwing it down to the timbers.  On the flanks it is
16992 cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping,
16993 battened hatchway.  Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots,
16994 two in number, and each of several barrels' capacity.  When not in
16995 use, they are kept remarkably clean.  Sometimes they are polished
16996 with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
16997 punch-bowls.  During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will
16998 crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap.  While
16999 employed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side--many
17000 confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips.  It
17001 is a place also for profound mathematical meditation.  It was in the
17002 left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently
17003 circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the
17004 remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the
17005 cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in
17006 precisely the same time.
17007 
17008 Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
17009 masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
17010 the furnaces, directly underneath the pots.  These mouths are fitted
17011 with heavy doors of iron.  The intense heat of the fire is prevented
17012 from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow
17013 reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works.
17014 By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished
17015 with water as fast as it evaporates.  There are no external chimneys;
17016 they open direct from the rear wall.  And here let us go back for a
17017 moment.
17018 
17019 It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's try-works were
17020 first started on this present voyage.  It belonged to Stubb to
17021 oversee the business.
17022 
17023 "All ready there?  Off hatch, then, and start her.  You cook, fire
17024 the works."  This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been
17025 thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage.  Here
17026 be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has
17027 to be fed for a time with wood.  After that no wood is used, except
17028 as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel.  In a word, after
17029 being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or
17030 fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties.
17031 These fritters feed the flames.  Like a plethoric burning martyr, or
17032 a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his
17033 own fuel and burns by his own body.  Would that he consumed his own
17034 smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must,
17035 and not only that, but you must live in it for the time.  It has an
17036 unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the
17037 vicinity of funereal pyres.  It smells like the left wing of the day
17038 of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.
17039 
17040 By midnight the works were in full operation.  We were clear from the
17041 carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
17042 darkness was intense.  But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
17043 flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
17044 illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
17045 fire.  The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
17046 some vengeful deed.  So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
17047 bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with
17048 broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates,
17049 and folded them in conflagrations.
17050 
17051 The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
17052 hearth in front of them.  Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes
17053 of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers.  With huge
17054 pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the
17055 scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames
17056 darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet.  The
17057 smoke rolled away in sullen heaps.  To every pitch of the ship there
17058 was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap
17059 into their faces.  Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further
17060 side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass.  This served for a
17061 sea-sofa.  Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,
17062 looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched
17063 in their heads.  Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke
17064 and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric
17065 brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the
17066 capricious emblazonings of the works.  As they narrated to each other
17067 their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of
17068 mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like
17069 the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the
17070 harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and
17071 dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship
17072 groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and
17073 further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
17074 champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
17075 all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden
17076 with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of
17077 darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac
17078 commander's soul.
17079 
17080 So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours
17081 silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.  Wrapped, for
17082 that interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness,
17083 the madness, the ghastliness of others.  The continual sight of the
17084 fiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire,
17085 these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to
17086 yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me
17087 at a midnight helm.
17088 
17089 But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since
17090 inexplicable) thing occurred to me.  Starting from a brief standing
17091 sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.  The
17092 jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears
17093 was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I
17094 thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers
17095 to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart.
17096 But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by;
17097 though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card, by
17098 the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.  Nothing seemed before me
17099 but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.
17100 Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I
17101 stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all
17102 havens astern.  A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over
17103 me.  Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy
17104 conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,
17105 inverted.  My God! what is the matter with me? thought I.  Lo! in my
17106 brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship's
17107 stern, with my back to her prow and the compass.  In an instant I
17108 faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into
17109 the wind, and very probably capsizing her.  How glad and how grateful
17110 the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the
17111 fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
17112 
17113 Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man!  Never dream with
17114 thy hand on the helm!  Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the
17115 first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire,
17116 when its redness makes all things look ghastly.  To-morrow, in the
17117 natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils
17118 in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least
17119 gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true
17120 lamp--all others but liars!
17121 
17122 Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's
17123 accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
17124 deserts and of griefs beneath the moon.  The sun hides not the ocean,
17125 which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
17126 earth.  So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than
17127 sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or
17128 undeveloped.  With books the same.  The truest of all men was the Man
17129 of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon's, and
17130 Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.  "All is vanity."
17131 ALL.  This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's
17132 wisdom yet.  But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast
17133 crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell;
17134 calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men;
17135 and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing
17136 wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit down on
17137 tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
17138 wondrous Solomon.
17139 
17140 But even Solomon, he says, "the man that wandereth out of the way of
17141 understanding shall remain" (I.E., even while living) "in the
17142 congregation of the dead."  Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest
17143 it invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me.  There is a
17144 wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness.  And there is
17145 a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the
17146 blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in
17147 the sunny spaces.  And even if he for ever flies within the gorge,
17148 that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the
17149 mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even
17150 though they soar.
17151

17154 CHAPTER 97
17155 
17156 The Lamp.
17157 
17158 
17159 Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's
17160 forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
17161 moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
17162 illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors.  There they
17163 lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled
17164 muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.
17165 
17166 In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
17167 queens.  To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
17168 darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot.  But the whaleman, as
17169 he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.  He makes his berth
17170 an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest
17171 night the ship's black hull still houses an illumination.
17172 
17173 See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
17174 lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper cooler
17175 at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a
17176 vat.  He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,
17177 therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or
17178 astral contrivances ashore.  It is sweet as early grass butter in
17179 April.  He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its
17180 freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts
17181 up his own supper of game.
17182 
17183 
17184 
17185 CHAPTER 98
17186 
17187 Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
17188 
17189 
17190 Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
17191 descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
17192 and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed
17193 alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the
17194 headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his
17195 great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
17196 due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach,
17197 and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through
17198 the fire;--but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this
17199 part of the description by rehearsing--singing, if I may--the
17200 romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and
17201 striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan returns
17202 to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as
17203 before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.
17204 
17205 While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
17206 six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and
17207 rolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are
17208 slewed round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously
17209 scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at
17210 last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops,
17211 rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX
17212 OFFICIO, every sailor is a cooper.
17213 
17214 At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the
17215 great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,
17216 and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea.  This done, the
17217 hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled
17218 up.
17219 
17220 In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
17221 incidents in all the business of whaling.  One day the planks stream
17222 with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous
17223 masses of the whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
17224 about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has
17225 besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with
17226 unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on
17227 all hands the din is deafening.
17228 
17229 But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in
17230 this self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and
17231 try-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant
17232 vessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.  The unmanufactured
17233 sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue.  This is the
17234 reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call
17235 an affair of oil.  Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of
17236 the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any
17237 adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side,
17238 that lye quickly exterminates it.  Hands go diligently along the
17239 bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their
17240 full tidiness.  The soot is brushed from the lower rigging.  All the
17241 numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully
17242 cleansed and put away.  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon
17243 the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of
17244 sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the
17245 combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's
17246 company, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded,
17247 then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift
17248 themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck,
17249 fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest
17250 Holland.
17251 
17252 Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
17253 humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
17254 propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object
17255 not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.  To
17256 hint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were
17257 little short of audacity.  They know not the thing you distantly
17258 allude to.  Away, and bring us napkins!
17259 
17260 But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men
17261 intent on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will
17262 again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small
17263 grease-spot somewhere.  Yes; and many is the time, when, after the
17264 severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing
17265 straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they
17266 have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only
17267 step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass,
17268 and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and
17269 burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the
17270 equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have
17271 finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless
17272 dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning
17273 the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of "There
17274 she blows!" and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through
17275 the whole weary thing again.  Oh! my friends, but this is
17276 man-killing!  Yet this is life.  For hardly have we mortals by long
17277 toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but
17278 valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves
17279 from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles
17280 of the soul; hardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost
17281 is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go
17282 through young life's old routine again.
17283 
17284 Oh! the metempsychosis!  Oh!  Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
17285 thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
17286 thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am,
17287 taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!
17288 
17289 
17290 
17291 CHAPTER 99
17292 
17293 The Doubloon.
17294 
17295 
17296 Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his
17297 quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and
17298 mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration
17299 it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most
17300 plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and
17301 stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him.  When
17302 he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the
17303 pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with
17304 the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he
17305 again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance
17306 fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same
17307 aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing,
17308 if not hopefulness.
17309 
17310 But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
17311 attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
17312 though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
17313 some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.  And
17314 some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are
17315 little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except
17316 to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up
17317 some morass in the Milky Way.
17318 
17319 Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
17320 the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden
17321 sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.  And though now
17322 nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of
17323 copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it
17324 still preserved its Quito glow.  Nor, though placed amongst a
17325 ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through
17326 the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover
17327 any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon
17328 where the sunset left it last.  For it was set apart and sanctified
17329 to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one
17330 and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman.
17331 Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering
17332 whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend
17333 it.
17334 
17335 Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the
17336 sun and tropic token-pieces.  Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes;
17337 sun's disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners
17338 waving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold
17339 seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories,
17340 by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
17341 
17342 It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy
17343 example of these things.  On its round border it bore the letters,
17344 REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO.  So this bright coin came from a
17345 country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great
17346 equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the
17347 Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn.  Zoned by those
17348 letters you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits; from one a
17349 flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching
17350 over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all
17351 marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering
17352 the equinoctial point at Libra.
17353 
17354 Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
17355 pausing.
17356 
17357 "There's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
17358 all other grand and lofty things; look here,--three peaks as proud as
17359 Lucifer.  The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab;
17360 the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is
17361 Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the
17362 rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man
17363 in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self.  Great pains, small
17364 gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve
17365 itself.  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see!
17366 aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months
17367 before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries!  From storm to
17368 storm!  So be it, then.  Born in throes, 't is fit that man should
17369 live in pains and die in pangs!  So be it, then!  Here's stout stuff
17370 for woe to work on.  So be it, then."
17371 
17372 "No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must have
17373 left their mouldings there since yesterday," murmured Starbuck to
17374 himself, leaning against the bulwarks.  "The old man seems to read
17375 Belshazzar's awful writing.  I have never marked the coin
17376 inspectingly.  He goes below; let me read.  A dark valley between
17377 three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in
17378 some faint earthly symbol.  So in this vale of Death, God girds us
17379 round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines
17380 a beacon and a hope.  If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows
17381 her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance
17382 half way, to cheer.  Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at
17383 midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze
17384 for him in vain!  This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still
17385 sadly to me.  I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely."
17386 
17387 "There now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,
17388 "he's been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and
17389 both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine
17390 fathoms long.  And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I
17391 have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it
17392 very long ere spending it.  Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion,
17393 I regard this as queer.  I have seen doubloons before now in my
17394 voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your
17395 doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of
17396 Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and
17397 half joes, and quarter joes.  What then should there be in this
17398 doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful?  By Golconda!
17399 let me read it once.  Halloa! here's signs and wonders truly!  That,
17400 now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what
17401 my almanac below calls ditto.  I'll get the almanac and as I have
17402 heard devils can be raised with Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my hand
17403 at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the
17404 Massachusetts calendar.  Here's the book.  Let's see now.  Signs and
17405 wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em.  Hem, hem, hem; here
17406 they are--here they go--all alive:--Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the
17407 Bull and Jimimi! here's Gemini himself, or the Twins.  Well; the sun
17408 he wheels among 'em.  Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the
17409 threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.  Book!
17410 you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places.  You'll
17411 do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the
17412 thoughts.  That's my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts
17413 calendar, and Bowditch's navigator, and Daboll's arithmetic go.
17414 Signs and wonders, eh?  Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs,
17415 and significant in wonders!  There's a clue somewhere; wait a bit;
17416 hist--hark!  By Jove, I have it!  Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac
17417 here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I'll read it
17418 off, straight out of the book.  Come, Almanack!  To begin: there's
17419 Aries, or the Ram--lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the
17420 Bull--he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins--that
17421 is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer
17422 the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a
17423 roaring Lion, lies in the path--he gives a few fierce bites and surly
17424 dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that's our
17425 first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
17426 Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while
17427 we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,
17428 or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when
17429 whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is
17430 amusing himself.  As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here's
17431 the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes
17432 rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the
17433 Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind
17434 up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.  There's a sermon now, writ
17435 in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes
17436 out of it all alive and hearty.  Jollily he, aloft there, wheels
17437 through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb.  Oh,
17438 jolly's the word for aye!  Adieu, Doubloon!  But stop; here comes
17439 little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let's hear what
17440 he'll have to say.  There; he's before it; he'll out with something
17441 presently.  So, so; he's beginning."
17442 
17443 "I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever
17444 raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.  So, what's
17445 all this staring been about?  It is worth sixteen dollars, that's
17446 true; and at two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty
17447 cigars.  I won't smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and
17448 here's nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to
17449 spy 'em out."
17450 
17451 "Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has
17452 a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a
17453 sort of wiseish look to it.  But, avast; here comes our old
17454 Manxman--the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he
17455 took to the sea.  He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes
17456 round on the other side of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed
17457 on that side; and now he's back again; what does that mean?  Hark!
17458 he's muttering--voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill.  Prick ears,
17459 and listen!"
17460 
17461 "If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
17462 the sun stands in some one of these signs.  I've studied signs, and
17463 know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old
17464 witch in Copenhagen.  Now, in what sign will the sun then be?  The
17465 horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold.  And
17466 what's the horse-shoe sign?  The lion is the horse-shoe sign--the
17467 roaring and devouring lion.  Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to
17468 think of thee."
17469 
17470 "There's another rendering now; but still one text.  All sorts of men
17471 in one kind of world, you see.  Dodge again! here comes Queequeg--all
17472 tattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.  What says the
17473 Cannibal?  As I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
17474 thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
17475 suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back
17476 country.  And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of
17477 his thigh--I guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer.  No: he don't
17478 know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off
17479 some king's trowsers.  But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,
17480 Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his
17481 pumps as usual.  What does he say, with that look of his?  Ah, only
17482 makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the
17483 coin--fire worshipper, depend upon it.  Ho! more and more.  This way
17484 comes Pip--poor boy! would he had died, or I; he's half horrible to
17485 me.  He too has been watching all of these interpreters--myself
17486 included--and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot
17487 face.  Stand away again and hear him.  Hark!"
17488 
17489 "I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."
17490 
17491 "Upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's Grammar!  Improving his
17492 mind, poor fellow!  But what's that he says now--hist!"
17493 
17494 "I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."
17495 
17496 "Why, he's getting it by heart--hist! again."
17497 
17498 "I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."
17499 
17500 "Well, that's funny."
17501 
17502 "And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I'm a
17503 crow, especially when I stand a'top of this pine tree here.  Caw!
17504 caw! caw! caw! caw! caw!  Ain't I a crow?  And where's the
17505 scare-crow?  There he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old
17506 trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket."
17507 
17508 "Wonder if he means me?--complimentary!--poor lad!--I could go hang
17509 myself.  Any way, for the present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity.  I can
17510 stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too crazy-witty
17511 for my sanity.  So, so, I leave him muttering."
17512 
17513 "Here's the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on
17514 fire to unscrew it.  But, unscrew your navel, and what's the
17515 consequence?  Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for
17516 when aught's nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow
17517 desperate.  Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he'll nail ye!  This
17518 is a pine tree.  My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine
17519 tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old
17520 darkey's wedding ring.  How did it get there?  And so they'll say in
17521 the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a
17522 doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark.  Oh,
17523 the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser'll hoard ye
17524 soon!  Hish! hish!  God goes 'mong the worlds blackberrying.  Cook!
17525 ho, cook! and cook us!  Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny!
17526 and get your hoe-cake done!"
17527

17529 
17530 CHAPTER 100
17531 
17532 Leg and Arm.
17533 
17534 The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
17535 
17536 
17537 "Ship, ahoy!  Hast seen the White Whale?"
17538 
17539 So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
17540 bearing down under the stern.  Trumpet to mouth, the old man was
17541 standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed
17542 to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own
17543 boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,
17544 fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious
17545 roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and
17546 one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered
17547 arm of a hussar's surcoat.
17548 
17549 "Hast seen the White Whale!"
17550 
17551 "See you this?" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden
17552 it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a
17553 wooden head like a mallet.
17554 
17555 "Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars
17556 near him--"Stand by to lower!"
17557 
17558 In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
17559 crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the
17560 stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the
17561 excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of
17562 his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but
17563 his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy
17564 mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be
17565 rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,
17566 it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost
17567 hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a
17568 boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up
17569 towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down
17570 to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of
17571 course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab
17572 now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;
17573 hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope
17574 to attain.
17575 
17576 It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
17577 circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
17578 luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.
17579 And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of
17580 the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
17581 perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him
17582 a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not
17583 seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a
17584 cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only
17585 lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance
17586 how affairs stood, cried out, "I see, I see!--avast heaving there!
17587 Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle."
17588 
17589 As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or
17590 two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
17591 curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the
17592 end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it
17593 all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like
17594 sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),
17595 and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time
17596 also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon
17597 one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung
17598 inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.
17599 With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain
17600 advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory
17601 arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, "Aye,
17602 aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm
17603 that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where
17604 did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?"
17605 
17606 "The White Whale," said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm
17607 towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had
17608 been a telescope; "there I saw him, on the Line, last season."
17609 
17610 "And he took that arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding down from
17611 the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.
17612 
17613 "Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"
17614 
17615 "Spin me the yarn," said Ahab; "how was it?"
17616 
17617 "It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,"
17618 began the Englishman.  "I was ignorant of the White Whale at that
17619 time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and
17620 my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,
17621 that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could
17622 only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.
17623 Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great
17624 whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and
17625 wrinkles."
17626 
17627 "It was he, it was he!" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his
17628 suspended breath.
17629 
17630 "And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin."
17631 
17632 "Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons," cried Ahab, exultingly--"but
17633 on!"
17634 
17635 "Give me a chance, then," said the Englishman, good-humoredly.
17636 "Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs
17637 all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my
17638 fast-line!
17639 
17640 "Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I
17641 know him."
17642 
17643 "How it was exactly," continued the one-armed commander, "I do not
17644 know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
17645 somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards
17646 pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of
17647 the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing
17648 how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest
17649 and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,
17650 spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the
17651 hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to
17652 might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a
17653 whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's
17654 boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;
17655 Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's
17656 boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and
17657 snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.
17658 But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next
17659 instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged
17660 and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up
17661 out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use
17662 sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding
17663 sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second
17664 iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,
17665 cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes
17666 first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all
17667 chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I
17668 seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment
17669 clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,
17670 and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,
17671 went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron
17672 towing along near me caught me here" (clapping his hand just below
17673 his shoulder); "yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to
17674 Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the
17675 good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the
17676 whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I
17677 floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the
17678 way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,--the
17679 captain).  Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn."
17680 
17681 The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all
17682 the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
17683 his gentlemanly rank on board.  His face was an exceedingly round but
17684 sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
17685 patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention
17686 between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in
17687 the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs
17688 of the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior's introduction of
17689 him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his
17690 captain's bidding.
17691 
17692 "It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking
17693 my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy--"
17694 
17695 "Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed
17696 captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."
17697 
17698 "Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
17699 hot weather there on the Line.  But it was no use--I did all I could;
17700 sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of
17701 diet--"
17702 
17703 "Oh, very severe!" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
17704 altering his voice, "Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night,
17705 till he couldn't see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,
17706 half seas over, about three o'clock in the morning.  Oh, ye stars! he
17707 sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet.  Oh! a great
17708 watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you
17709 dog, laugh out! why don't ye?  You know you're a precious jolly
17710 rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept
17711 alive by any other man."
17712 
17713 "My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir"--said
17714 the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab--"is
17715 apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that
17716 sort.  But I may as well say--en passant, as the French remark--that
17717 I myself--that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend
17718 clergy--am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink--"
17719 
17720 "Water!" cried the captain; "he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits
17721 to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on--go on
17722 with the arm story."
17723 
17724 "Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon, coolly.  "I was about
17725 observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that
17726 spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse
17727 and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon
17728 ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it
17729 with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was
17730 threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that
17731 ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule"--pointing at it with
17732 the marlingspike--"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered
17733 the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the
17734 end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine
17735 once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this
17736 dent, sir"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and
17737 exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the
17738 slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a
17739 wound--"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;
17740 he knows."
17741 
17742 "No, I don't," said the captain, "but his mother did; he was born
17743 with it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such
17744 another Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought
17745 to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages,
17746 you rascal."
17747 
17748 "What became of the White Whale?" now cried Ahab, who thus far had
17749 been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two
17750 Englishmen.
17751 
17752 "Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, "oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,
17753 we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
17754 didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
17755 till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard
17756 about Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he."
17757 
17758 "Did'st thou cross his wake again?"
17759 
17760 "Twice."
17761 
17762 "But could not fasten?"
17763 
17764 "Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough?  What should I do
17765 without this other arm?  And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so
17766 much as he swallows."
17767 
17768 "Well, then," interrupted Bunger, "give him your left arm for bait to
17769 get the right.  Do you know, gentlemen"--very gravely and
17770 mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--"Do you know,
17771 gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably
17772 constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him
17773 to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that
17774 what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.
17775 For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to
17776 terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,
17777 formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow
17778 jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,
17779 and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an
17780 emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see.  No possible
17781 way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into
17782 his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick
17783 enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the
17784 privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case
17785 the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you
17786 shortly, that's all."
17787 
17788 "No, thank ye, Bunger," said the English Captain, "he's welcome to
17789 the arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but
17790 not to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for
17791 him once, and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in
17792 killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm
17793 in him, but, hark ye, he's best let alone; don't you think so,
17794 Captain?"--glancing at the ivory leg.
17795 
17796 "He is.  But he will still be hunted, for all that.  What is best let
17797 alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.  He's
17798 all a magnet!  How long since thou saw'st him last?  Which way
17799 heading?"
17800 
17801 "Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's," cried Bunger, stoopingly
17802 walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; "this man's
17803 blood--bring the thermometer!--it's at the boiling point!--his pulse
17804 makes these planks beat!--sir!"--taking a lancet from his pocket, and
17805 drawing near to Ahab's arm.
17806 
17807 "Avast!" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--"Man the
17808 boat!  Which way heading?"
17809 
17810 "Good God!" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
17811 "What's the matter?  He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain
17812 crazy?" whispering Fedallah.
17813 
17814 But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
17815 take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
17816 towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.
17817 
17818 In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men
17819 were springing to their oars.  In vain the English Captain hailed
17820 him.  With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to
17821 his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.

17825 CHAPTER 101
17826 
17827 The Decanter.
17828 
17829 
17830 Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
17831 hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
17832 merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
17833 Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes
17834 not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in
17835 point of real historical interest.  How long, prior to the year of
17836 our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
17837 fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted
17838 out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm
17839 Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our
17840 valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large
17841 fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South
17842 Atlantic: not elsewhere.  Be it distinctly recorded here, that the
17843 Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized
17844 steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were
17845 the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.
17846 
17847 In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
17848 and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape
17849 Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of
17850 any sort in the great South Sea.  The voyage was a skilful and lucky
17851 one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious
17852 sperm, the Amelia's example was soon followed by other ships, English
17853 and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific
17854 were thrown open.  But not content with this good deed, the
17855 indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his
17856 Sons--how many, their mother only knows--and under their immediate
17857 auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British
17858 government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling
17859 voyage of discovery into the South Sea.  Commanded by a naval
17860 Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some
17861 service; how much does not appear.  But this is not all.  In 1819,
17862 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go
17863 on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.  That ship--well
17864 called the "Syren"--made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus
17865 that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.
17866 The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a
17867 Nantucketer.
17868 
17869 All honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists
17870 to the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long
17871 ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other
17872 world.
17873 
17874 The ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast
17875 sailer and a noble craft every way.  I boarded her once at midnight
17876 somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
17877 forecastle.  It was a fine gam we had, and they were all
17878 trumps--every soul on board.  A short life to them, and a jolly
17879 death.  And that fine gam I had--long, very long after old Ahab
17880 touched her planks with his ivory heel--it minds me of the noble,
17881 solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me,
17882 and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it.  Flip?  Did I
17883 say we had flip?  Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons
17884 the hour; and when the squall came (for it's squally off there by
17885 Patagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were called to reef
17886 topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft
17887 in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into
17888 the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a
17889 warning example to all drunken tars.  However, the masts did not go
17890 overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to
17891 pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the
17892 forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my
17893 taste.
17894 
17895 The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it.  They said it was
17896 bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
17897 certain, how that was.  They had dumplings too; small, but
17898 substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings.  I
17899 fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after
17900 they were swallowed.  If you stooped over too far forward, you risked
17901 their pitching out of you like billiard-balls.  The bread--but that
17902 couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the
17903 bread contained the only fresh fare they had.  But the forecastle was
17904 not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner
17905 when you ate it.  But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,
17906 considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers, including his own
17907 live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a
17908 jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack
17909 fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.
17910 
17911 But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
17912 English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous,
17913 hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the
17914 can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking,
17915 and laughing?  I will tell you.  The abounding good cheer of these
17916 English whalers is matter for historical research.  Nor have I been
17917 at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed
17918 needed.
17919 
17920 The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
17921 Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
17922 in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,
17923 touching plenty to eat and drink.  For, as a general thing, the
17924 English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English
17925 whaler.  Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is
17926 not normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and,
17927 therefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out,
17928 and will be still further elucidated.
17929 
17930 During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
17931 ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew
17932 must be about whalers.  The title was, "Dan Coopman," wherefore I
17933 concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
17934 cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper.  I
17935 was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production
17936 of one "Fitz Swackhammer."  But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very
17937 learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of
17938 Santa Claus and St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for
17939 translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble--this
17940 same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that "Dan
17941 Coopman" did not mean "The Cooper," but "The Merchant."  In short,
17942 this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of
17943 Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very interesting
17944 account of its whale fishery.  And in this chapter it was, headed,
17945 "Smeer," or "Fat," that I found a long detailed list of the outfits
17946 for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which
17947 list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:
17948 
17949 400,000 lbs. of beef.
17950 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.
17951 150,000 lbs. of stock fish.
17952 550,000 lbs. of biscuit.
17953 72,000 lbs. of soft bread.
17954 2,800 firkins of butter.
17955 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese.
17956 144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).
17957 550 ankers of Geneva.
17958 10,800 barrels of beer.
17959 
17960 Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
17961 the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole
17962 pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
17963 
17964 At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
17965 this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
17966 incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and
17967 Platonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary
17968 tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc.,
17969 consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and
17970 Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,
17971 and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.  I impute it,
17972 though, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still
17973 more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by
17974 their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very
17975 coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge
17976 each other in bumpers of train oil.
17977 
17978 The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels.  Now,
17979 as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer
17980 of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch
17981 whalemen, including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea,
17982 did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each
17983 of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all;
17984 therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for
17985 a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that
17986 550 ankers of gin.  Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so
17987 fuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of
17988 men to stand up in a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales;
17989 this would seem somewhat improbable.  Yet they did aim at them, and
17990 hit them too.  But this was very far North, be it remembered, where
17991 beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our
17992 southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at
17993 the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to
17994 Nantucket and New Bedford.
17995 
17996 But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers
17997 of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
17998 whalers have not neglected so excellent an example.  For, say they,
17999 when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of
18000 the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least.  And this empties
18001 the decanter.
18002 
18003 
18004 
18005 CHAPTER 102
18006 
18007 A Bower in the Arsacides.
18008 
18009 
18010 Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have
18011 chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and
18012 in detail upon some few interior structural features.  But to a large
18013 and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to
18014 unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,
18015 unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of
18016 the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his
18017 ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.
18018 
18019 But how now, Ishmael?  How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
18020 fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
18021 whale?  Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver
18022 lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass,
18023 hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?  Explain thyself, Ishmael.
18024 Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a
18025 cook dishes a roast-pig?  Surely not.  A veritable witness have you
18026 hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege
18027 of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and
18028 beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making
18029 up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,
18030 dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.
18031 
18032 I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
18033 beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been
18034 blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature.  In a ship I
18035 belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the
18036 deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the
18037 harpoons, and for the heads of the lances.  Think you I let that
18038 chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking
18039 the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub?
18040 
18041 And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
18042 gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am
18043 indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of
18044 the Arsacides.  For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the
18045 trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the
18046 Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm
18047 villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our
18048 sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.
18049 
18050 Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being
18051 gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had
18052 brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious
18053 of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful
18054 devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic
18055 canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
18056 wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.
18057 
18058 Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
18059 unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with
18060 his head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted
18061 droopings seemed his verdant jet.  When the vast body had at last
18062 been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become
18063 dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up
18064 the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered
18065 it.
18066 
18067 The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with
18068 Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the
18069 priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic
18070 head again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a
18071 bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like
18072 the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.
18073 
18074 It was a wondrous sight.  The wood was green as mosses of the Icy
18075 Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
18076 industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a gorgeous
18077 carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
18078 woof, and the living flowers the figures.  All the trees, with all
18079 their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
18080 message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active.  Through the
18081 lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
18082 the unwearied verdure.  Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one
18083 word!--whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore
18084 all these ceaseless toilings?  Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but
18085 one single word with thee!  Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float
18086 from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides
18087 away.  The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened,
18088 that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look
18089 on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear
18090 the thousand voices that speak through it.  For even so it is in all
18091 material factories.  The spoken words that are inaudible among the
18092 flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the
18093 walls, bursting from the opened casements.  Thereby have villainies
18094 been detected.  Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din
18095 of the great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard
18096 afar.
18097 
18098 Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
18099 great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler!
18100 Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed
18101 around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all
18102 woven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher
18103 verdure; but himself a skeleton.  Life folded Death; Death trellised
18104 Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him
18105 curly-headed glories.
18106 
18107 Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw
18108 the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the
18109 real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel
18110 as an object of vertu.  He laughed.  But more I marvelled that the
18111 priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fro I
18112 paced before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through
18113 the ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long
18114 amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours.  But soon my
18115 line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I
18116 entered.  I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.
18117 
18118 Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the
18119 skeleton.  From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived
18120 me taking the altitude of the final rib, "How now!" they shouted;
18121 "Dar'st thou measure this our god!  That's for us."  "Aye,
18122 priests--well, how long do ye make him, then?"  But hereupon a fierce
18123 contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked
18124 each other's sconces with their yard-sticks--the great skull
18125 echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own
18126 admeasurements.
18127 
18128 These admeasurements I now propose to set before you.  But first, be
18129 it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
18130 measurement I please.  Because there are skeleton authorities you
18131 can refer to, to test my accuracy.  There is a Leviathanic Museum,
18132 they tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that
18133 country, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other
18134 whales.  Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in
18135 New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call "the only perfect
18136 specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States."
18137 Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name,
18138 a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton
18139 of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown
18140 magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.
18141 
18142 In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
18143 belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
18144 grounds.  King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
18145 Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts.  Sir
18146 Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a
18147 great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
18148 cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day
18149 upon his lower jaw.  Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors
18150 and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a
18151 bunch of keys at his side.  Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence
18152 for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence
18153 to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for
18154 the unrivalled view from his forehead.
18155 
18156 The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
18157 verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
18158 wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of
18159 preserving such valuable statistics.  But as I was crowded for space,
18160 and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a
18161 poem I was then composing--at least, what untattooed parts might
18162 remain--I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed,
18163 should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the
18164 whale.

18168 CHAPTER 103
18169 
18170 Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton.
18171 
18172 
18173 In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
18174 statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton
18175 we are briefly to exhibit.  Such a statement may prove useful here.
18176 
18177 According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly
18178 base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the
18179 largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to
18180 my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest
18181 magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and
18182 something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a
18183 whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen
18184 men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population
18185 of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.
18186 
18187 Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
18188 this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's
18189 imagination?
18190 
18191 Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
18192 jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
18193 simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
18194 unobstructed bones.  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large
18195 a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far
18196 the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated
18197 concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your
18198 mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a
18199 complete notion of the general structure we are about to view.
18200 
18201 In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
18202 Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
18203 been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
18204 fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two
18205 feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some
18206 fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for
18207 something less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular
18208 basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.
18209 
18210 To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
18211 extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
18212 the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
18213 twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
18214 for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.
18215 
18216 The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was
18217 nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
18218 successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
18219 of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From
18220 that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last
18221 only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they
18222 all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs
18223 were the most arched.  In some of the Arsacides they are used for
18224 beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.
18225 
18226 In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
18227 circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton
18228 of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.  The
18229 largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that
18230 part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the
18231 greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must
18232 have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib
18233 measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only
18234 conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that
18235 part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all
18236 that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,
18237 muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here
18238 saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and
18239 majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
18240 
18241 How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to
18242 try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over
18243 his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.
18244 Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings
18245 of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the
18246 fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.
18247 
18248 But the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
18249 crane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.  But
18250 now it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.
18251 
18252 There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are
18253 not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks
18254 on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The
18255 largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,
18256 and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers
18257 away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something
18258 like a white billiard-ball.  I was told that there were still smaller
18259 ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the
18260 priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with.  Thus we
18261 see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off
18262 at last into simple child's play.
18263 
18264 
18265 
18266 CHAPTER 104
18267 
18268 The Fossil Whale.
18269 
18270 
18271 From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
18272 to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate.  Would you, you could
18273 not compress him.  By good rights he should only be treated of in
18274 imperial folio.  Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to
18275 tail, and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the
18276 gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like
18277 great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck
18278 of a line-of-battle-ship.
18279 
18280 Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me
18281 to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
18282 overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
18283 out to the uttermost coil of his bowels.  Having already described
18284 him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities,
18285 it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous,
18286 and antediluvian point of view.  Applied to any other creature than
18287 the Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--such portly terms might justly be
18288 deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.  But when Leviathan is the text,
18289 the case is altered.  Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under
18290 the weightiest words of the dictionary.  And here be it said, that
18291 whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these
18292 dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of
18293 Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous
18294 lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a
18295 lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.
18296 
18297 One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
18298 though it may seem but an ordinary one.  How, then, with me, writing
18299 of this Leviathan?  Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
18300 capitals.  Give me a condor's quill!  Give me Vesuvius' crater for an
18301 inkstand!  Friends, hold my arms!  For in the mere act of penning my
18302 thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with
18303 their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the
18304 whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and
18305 men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the
18306 revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole
18307 universe, not excluding its suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the
18308 virtue of a large and liberal theme!  We expand to its bulk.  To
18309 produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.  No great and
18310 enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be
18311 who have tried it.
18312 
18313 Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my
18314 credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time
18315 I have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches,
18316 canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts.
18317 Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that
18318 while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of
18319 monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics
18320 discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the
18321 connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the
18322 antichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to
18323 have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered
18324 belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the
18325 superficial formations.  And though none of them precisely answer to
18326 any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin
18327 to them in general respects, to justify their taking rank as
18328 Cetacean fossils.
18329 
18330 Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their
18331 bones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various
18332 intervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in
18333 France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana,
18334 Mississippi, and Alabama.  Among the more curious of such remains is
18335 part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue
18336 Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the
18337 palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the
18338 great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's time.  Cuvier pronounced these
18339 fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic
18340 species.
18341 
18342 But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
18343 complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
18344 on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.  The awe-stricken
18345 credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the
18346 fallen angels.  The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
18347 bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus.  But some specimen bones
18348 of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it
18349 turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a
18350 departed species.  A significant illustration of the fact, again and
18351 again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes
18352 but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body.  So Owen
18353 rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the
18354 London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the
18355 most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have
18356 blotted out of existence.
18357 
18358 When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
18359 jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances
18360 to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing
18361 on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
18362 Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back
18363 to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;
18364 for time began with man.  Here Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and
18365 I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when
18366 wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics;
18367 and in all the 25,000 miles of this world's circumference, not an
18368 inhabitable hand's breadth of land was visible.  Then the whole world
18369 was the whale's; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
18370 present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs.  Who can show a
18371 pedigree like Leviathan?  Ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than
18372 the Pharaoh's.  Methuselah seems a school-boy.  I look round to shake
18373 hands with Shem.  I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced
18374 existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been
18375 before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
18376 
18377 But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
18378 stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
18379 ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to
18380 claim for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the
18381 unmistakable print of his fin.  In an apartment of the great temple
18382 of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the
18383 granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in
18384 centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures
18385 on the celestial globe of the moderns.  Gliding among them, old
18386 Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere,
18387 centuries before Solomon was cradled.
18388 
18389 Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the
18390 antiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as
18391 set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
18392 
18393 "Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
18394 of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
18395 oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.  The Common People imagine,
18396 that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can
18397 pass it without immediate death.  But the truth of the Matter is,
18398 that on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two
18399 Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em.
18400 They keep a Whale's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which
18401 lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch,
18402 the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back.
18403 This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years
18404 before I saw it.  Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who
18405 prophesy'd of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand
18406 to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the
18407 Base of the Temple."
18408 
18409 In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be
18410 a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.
18411 
18412 
18413 
18414 CHAPTER 105
18415 
18416 Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?--Will He Perish?
18417 
18418 
18419 Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
18420 the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
18421 in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from
18422 the original bulk of his sires.
18423 
18424 But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
18425 present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
18426 found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
18427 prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
18428 belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its
18429 earlier ones.
18430 
18431 Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
18432 Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
18433 seventy feet in length in the skeleton.  Whereas, we have already
18434 seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton
18435 of a large sized modern whale.  And I have heard, on whalemen's
18436 authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet
18437 long at the time of capture.
18438 
18439 But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
18440 advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods;
18441 may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?
18442 
18443 Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
18444 such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally.  For
18445 Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and
18446 Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in
18447 length--Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!  And even in the
18448 days of Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish
18449 member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales
18450 (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;
18451 that is, three hundred and sixty feet.  And Lacepede, the French
18452 naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning
18453 of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred
18454 metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.  And this work was
18455 published so late as A.D. 1825.
18456 
18457 But will any whaleman believe these stories?  No.  The whale of
18458 to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time.  And if ever I go
18459 where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to
18460 tell him so.  Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the
18461 Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even
18462 Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern
18463 Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals
18464 sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the
18465 relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove
18466 that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only
18467 equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine;
18468 in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the
18469 whale alone should have degenerated.
18470 
18471 But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
18472 recondite Nantucketers.  Whether owing to the almost omniscient
18473 look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even
18474 through Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
18475 lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted
18476 along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan
18477 can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether
18478 he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last
18479 whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself
18480 evaporate in the final puff.
18481 
18482 Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of
18483 buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands
18484 the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and
18485 scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
18486 river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a
18487 dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would
18488 seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape
18489 speedy extinction.
18490 
18491 But you must look at this matter in every light.  Though so short a
18492 period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in
18493 Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the
18494 present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region;
18495 and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of
18496 man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily
18497 forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.  Forty men in one ship
18498 hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done
18499 extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of
18500 forty fish.  Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian
18501 hunters and trappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset
18502 suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of
18503 moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse
18504 instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty
18505 thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be
18506 statistically stated.
18507 
18508 Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
18509 gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former
18510 years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
18511 small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
18512 consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much
18513 more remunerative.  Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those
18514 whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in
18515 immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries,
18516 yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into
18517 vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.  That is all.  And
18518 equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called
18519 whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
18520 abounding with them, hence that species also is declining.  For they
18521 are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no
18522 longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and
18523 remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar
18524 spectacle.
18525 
18526 Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have
18527 two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever
18528 remain impregnable.  And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the
18529 frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the
18530 savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at
18531 last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate
18532 glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes;
18533 and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all
18534 pursuit from man.
18535 
18536 But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
18537 cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that
18538 this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their
18539 battalions.  But though for some time past a number of these whales,
18540 not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor'-west
18541 coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations which
18542 render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing
18543 argument in this matter.
18544 
18545 Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the
18546 populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what
18547 shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at
18548 one hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those
18549 regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate
18550 climes.  And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants,
18551 which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by
18552 Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the
18553 East--if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the
18554 great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate
18555 in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas,
18556 Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
18557 combined.
18558 
18559 Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity
18560 of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
18561 therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult
18562 generations must be contemporary.  And what that is, we may soon
18563 gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and
18564 family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men,
18565 women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding
18566 this countless host to the present human population of the globe.
18567 
18568 Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
18569 species, however perishable in his individuality.  He swam the seas
18570 before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
18571 Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin.  In Noah's flood he
18572 despised Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded,
18573 like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale
18574 will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the
18575 equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.

18579 CHAPTER 106
18580 
18581 Ahab's Leg.
18582 
18583 
18584 The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
18585 Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence
18586 to his own person.  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of
18587 his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock.
18588 And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he
18589 so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman
18590 (it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly
18591 enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional
18592 twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all
18593 appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.
18594 
18595 And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
18596 pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to
18597 the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood.  For it
18598 had not been very long prior to the Pequod's sailing from Nantucket,
18599 that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and
18600 insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable
18601 casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it
18602 had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it
18603 without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely
18604 cured.
18605 
18606 Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that
18607 all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct
18608 issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the
18609 most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as
18610 inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with
18611 every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like.
18612 Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and
18613 posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy.
18614 For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain
18615 canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have
18616 no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,
18617 shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;
18618 whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to
18619 themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the
18620 grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in
18621 the deeper analysis of the thing.  For, thought Ahab, while even the
18622 highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness
18623 lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic
18624 significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their
18625 diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.  To trail the
18626 genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among
18627 the sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of
18628 all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round
18629 harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods
18630 themselves are not for ever glad.  The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark
18631 in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.
18632 
18633 Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
18634 properly, in set way, have been disclosed before.  With many other
18635 particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to
18636 some, why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after
18637 the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
18638 Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
18639 speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
18640 Captain Peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
18641 adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab's deeper part, every
18642 revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
18643 light.  But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at
18644 least.  That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary
18645 recluseness.  And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,
18646 dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege
18647 of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above
18648 hinted casualty--remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by
18649 Ahab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the
18650 land of spirits and of wails.  So that, through their zeal for him,
18651 they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the
18652 knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till
18653 a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the
18654 Pequod's decks.
18655 
18656 But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the
18657 air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or
18658 not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he
18659 took plain practical procedures;--he called the carpenter.
18660 
18661 And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
18662 delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
18663 supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale)
18664 which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a
18665 careful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be
18666 secured.  This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg
18667 completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,
18668 independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use.
18669 Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its
18670 temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the
18671 blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of
18672 whatever iron contrivances might be needed.
18673 
18674 
18675 
18676 CHAPTER 107
18677 
18678 The Carpenter.
18679 
18680 
18681 Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
18682 abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.
18683 But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part,
18684 they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and
18685 hereditary.  But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing
18686 an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod's carpenter
18687 was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.
18688 
18689 Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those
18690 belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed,
18691 practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings
18692 collateral to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and
18693 outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or
18694 less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material.  But, besides the
18695 application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the
18696 Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical
18697 emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or
18698 four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas.  For not to
18699 speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:--repairing stove boats,
18700 sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting
18701 bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and
18702 other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special
18703 business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of
18704 conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.
18705 
18706 The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so
18707 manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished
18708 with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.
18709 At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was
18710 securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
18711 
18712 A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its
18713 hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and
18714 straightway files it smaller.  A lost land-bird of strange plumage
18715 strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
18716 right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter
18717 makes a pagoda-looking cage for it.  An oarsman sprains his wrist:
18718 the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion.  Stubb longed for
18719 vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar;
18720 screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter
18721 symmetrically supplies the constellation.  A sailor takes a fancy to
18722 wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.  Another
18723 has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand
18724 upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow
18725 unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round
18726 the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his
18727 jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.
18728 
18729 Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike
18730 indifferent and without respect in all.  Teeth he accounted bits of
18731 ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held
18732 for capstans.  But while now upon so wide a field thus variously
18733 accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all
18734 this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.  But
18735 not precisely so.  For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for
18736 a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it
18737 so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed
18738 one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible
18739 world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still
18740 eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig
18741 foundations for cathedrals.  Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in
18742 him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying
18743 heartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,
18744 crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now
18745 and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served
18746 to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
18747 of Noah's ark.  Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long
18748 wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no
18749 moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward
18750 clingings might have originally pertained to him?  He was a stript
18751 abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe;
18752 living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.  You
18753 might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved
18754 a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem
18755 to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had
18756 been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
18757 uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
18758 process.  He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had
18759 one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.  He
18760 was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, MULTUM IN
18761 PARVO, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little
18762 swelled--of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of
18763 various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
18764 pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers.  So, if his superiors
18765 wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do
18766 was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for
18767 tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.
18768 
18769 Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
18770 was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton.  If he did not have
18771 a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow
18772 anomalously did its duty.  What that was, whether essence of
18773 quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling.  But
18774 there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or
18775 more.  And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning
18776 life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the
18777 time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also
18778 hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this
18779 soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep himself
18780 awake.

18791 (CARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICE-BENCH, AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWO
18792 LANTERNS BUSILY FILING THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG, WHICH JOIST IS

18794 SCREWS, AND VARIOUS TOOLS OF ALL SORTS LYING ABOUT THE BENCH.

18797 
18798 
18799 Drat the file, and drat the bone!  That is hard which should be soft,
18800 and that is soft which should be hard.  So we go, who file old jaws
18801 and shinbones.  Let's try another.  Aye, now, this works better
18802 (SNEEZES).  Halloa, this bone dust is (SNEEZES)--why it's
18803 (SNEEZES)--yes it's (SNEEZES)--bless my soul, it won't let me speak!
18804 This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber.  Saw
18805 a live tree, and you don't get this dust; amputate a live bone, and
18806 you don't get it (SNEEZES).  Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a
18807 hand, and let's have that ferule and buckle-screw; I'll be ready
18808 for them presently.  Lucky now (SNEEZES) there's no knee-joint to
18809 make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere shinbone--why it's
18810 easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to put a good finish on.
18811 Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat
18812 a leg now as ever (SNEEZES) scraped to a lady in a parlor.  Those
18813 buckskin legs and calves of legs I've seen in shop windows wouldn't
18814 compare at all.  They soak water, they do; and of course get
18815 rheumatic, and have to be doctored (SNEEZES) with washes and lotions,
18816 just like live legs.  There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his
18817 old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too
18818 short, if anything, I guess.  Ha! that's the heel; we are in luck;
18819 here he comes, or it's somebody else, that's certain.
18820 
18821 AHAB (ADVANCING)
18822 
18823 (DURING THE ENSUING SCENE, THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMES)
18824 
18825 
18826 Well, manmaker!
18827 
18828 Just in time, sir.  If the captain pleases, I will now mark the
18829 length.  Let me measure, sir.
18830 
18831 Measured for a leg! good.  Well, it's not the first time.  About it!
18832 There; keep thy finger on it.  This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
18833 carpenter; let me feel its grip once.  So, so; it does pinch some.
18834 
18835 Oh, sir, it will break bones--beware, beware!
18836 
18837 No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this
18838 slippery world that can hold, man.  What's Prometheus about
18839 there?--the blacksmith, I mean--what's he about?
18840 
18841 He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
18842 
18843 Right.  It's a partnership; he supplies the muscle part.  He makes a
18844 fierce red flame there!
18845 
18846 Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
18847 
18848 Um-m.  So he must.  I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that
18849 old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
18850 blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what's made in fire must
18851 properly belong to fire; and so hell's probable.  How the soot flies!
18852 This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.
18853 Carpenter, when he's through with that buckle, tell him to forge a
18854 pair of steel shoulder-blades; there's a pedlar aboard with a
18855 crushing pack.
18856 
18857 Sir?
18858 
18859 Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man after a
18860 desirable pattern.  Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then,
18861 chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to 'em,
18862 to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no
18863 heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine
18864 brains; and let me see--shall I order eyes to see outwards?  No, but
18865 put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards.  There,
18866 take the order, and away.
18867 
18868 Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should
18869 like to know?  Shall I keep standing here? (ASIDE).
18870 
18871 'Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here's one.
18872 No, no, no; I must have a lantern.
18873 
18874 Ho, ho!  That's it, hey?  Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
18875 
18876 What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
18877 Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.
18878 
18879 I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
18880 
18881 
18882 Carpenter? why that's--but no;--a very tidy, and, I may say, an
18883 extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,
18884 carpenter;--or would'st thou rather work in clay?
18885 
18886 Sir?--Clay? clay, sir?  That's mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
18887 
18888 The fellow's impious!  What art thou sneezing about?
18889 
18890 Bone is rather dusty, sir.
18891 
18892 Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
18893 living people's noses.
18894 
18895 Sir?--oh! ah!--I guess so;--yes--dear!
18896 
18897 Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
18898 workmanlike workman, eh?  Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well
18899 for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
18900 nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it;
18901 that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean.
18902 Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?
18903 
18904 Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now.  Yes, I have heard
18905 something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
18906 entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
18907 pricking him at times.  May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
18908 
18909 It is, man.  Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
18910 was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to
18911 the soul.  Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there,
18912 there to a hair, do I.  Is't a riddle?
18913 
18914 I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
18915 
18916 Hist, then.  How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking
18917 thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing
18918 precisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy
18919 spite?  In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear
18920 eavesdroppers?  Hold, don't speak!  And if I still feel the smart of
18921 my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst
18922 not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and
18923 without a body?  Hah!
18924 
18925 Good Lord!  Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over
18926 again; I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.
18927 
18928 Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.--How long before
18929 the leg is done?
18930 
18931 Perhaps an hour, sir.
18932 
18933 Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (TURNS TO GO).  Oh, Life!
18934 Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this
18935 blockhead for a bone to stand on!  Cursed be that mortal
18936 inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers.  I would be
18937 free as air; and I'm down in the whole world's books.  I am so rich,
18938 I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the
18939 auction of the Roman empire (which was the world's); and yet I owe
18940 for the flesh in the tongue I brag with.  By heavens!  I'll get a
18941 crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small,
18942 compendious vertebra.  So.
18943 
18944 CARPENTER (RESUMING HIS WORK).
18945 
18946 
18947 Well, well, well!  Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
18948 he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
18949 he's queer, says Stubb; he's queer--queer, queer; and keeps dinning
18950 it into Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very
18951 queer.  And here's his leg!  Yes, now that I think of it, here's his
18952 bedfellow! has a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife!  And this is
18953 his leg; he'll stand on this.  What was that now about one leg
18954 standing in three places, and all three places standing in one
18955 hell--how was that?  Oh!  I don't wonder he looked so scornful at me!
18956 I'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that's only
18957 haphazard-like.  Then, a short, little old body like me, should never
18958 undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built
18959 captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and
18960 there's a great cry for life-boats.  And here's the heron's leg! long
18961 and slim, sure enough!  Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a
18962 lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a
18963 tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses.  But
18964 Ahab; oh he's a hard driver.  Look, driven one leg to death, and
18965 spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.
18966 Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and
18967 let's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with
18968 his horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round
18969 collecting old beer barrels, to fill 'em up again.  What a leg this
18970 is!  It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the
18971 core; he'll be standing on this to-morrow; he'll be taking altitudes
18972 on it.  Halloa!  I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed
18973 ivory, where he figures up the latitude.  So, so; chisel, file, and
18974 sand-paper, now!
18975 
18976 
18977 
18978 CHAPTER 109
18979 
18980 Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.
18981 
18982 
18983 According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo!
18984 no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must
18985 have sprung a bad leak.  Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went
18986 down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*
18987 
18988 
18989 *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
18990 is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
18991 drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
18992 intervals, is removed by the ship's pumps.  Hereby the casks are
18993 sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the
18994 withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in
18995 the precious cargo.
18996 
18997 
18998 Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa
18999 and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets
19000 from the China waters into the Pacific.  And so Starbuck found Ahab
19001 with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;
19002 and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
19003 Japanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his snow-white
19004 new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a
19005 long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,
19006 with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and
19007 tracing his old courses again.
19008 
19009 "Who's there?" hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning
19010 round to it.  "On deck!  Begone!"
19011 
19012 "Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I.  The oil in the hold is leaking,
19013 sir.  We must up Burtons and break out."
19014 
19015 "Up Burtons and break out?  Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to
19016 here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?"
19017 
19018 "Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make
19019 good in a year.  What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
19020 saving, sir."
19021 
19022 "So it is, so it is; if we get it."
19023 
19024 "I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir."
19025 
19026 "And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all.  Begone!  Let it
19027 leak!  I'm all aleak myself.  Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of
19028 leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a
19029 far worse plight than the Pequod's, man.  Yet I don't stop to plug my
19030 leak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to
19031 plug it, even if found, in this life's howling gale?  Starbuck!
19032 I'll not have the Burtons hoisted."
19033 
19034 "What will the owners say, sir?"
19035 
19036 "Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons.
19037 What cares Ahab?  Owners, owners?  Thou art always prating to me,
19038 Starbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my
19039 conscience.  But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its
19040 commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship's keel.--On
19041 deck!"
19042 
19043 "Captain Ahab," said the reddening mate, moving further into the
19044 cabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it
19045 almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest
19046 outward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than
19047 half distrustful of itself; "A better man than I might well pass over
19048 in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye,
19049 and in a happier, Captain Ahab."
19050 
19051 "Devils!  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of
19052 me?--On deck!"
19053 
19054 "Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat.  And I do dare, sir--to be
19055 forbearing!  Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,
19056 Captain Ahab?"
19057 
19058 Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
19059 South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
19060 exclaimed: "There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
19061 Captain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!"
19062 
19063 For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery
19064 cheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really received the
19065 blaze of the levelled tube.  But, mastering his emotion, he half
19066 calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and
19067 said: "Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask
19068 thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab
19069 beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man."
19070 
19071 "He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!"
19072 murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.  "What's that he said--Ahab
19073 beware of Ahab--there's something there!"  Then unconsciously using
19074 the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the
19075 little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed,
19076 and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
19077 
19078 "Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck," he said lowly to the
19079 mate; then raising his voice to the crew: "Furl the t'gallant-sails,
19080 and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up
19081 Burton, and break out in the main-hold."
19082 
19083 It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as
19084 respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.  It may have been a flash of
19085 honesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the
19086 circumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open
19087 disaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of
19088 his ship.  However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons
19089 were hoisted.
19090 
19091 
19092 
19093 CHAPTER 110
19094 
19095 Queequeg in His Coffin.
19096 
19097 
19098 Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
19099 were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off.  So, it
19100 being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
19101 slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
19102 sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.  So deep did
19103 they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the
19104 lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy
19105 corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of
19106 the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the
19107 flood.  Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and
19108 shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till
19109 at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull
19110 echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and
19111 reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.
19112 Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in
19113 his head.  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.
19114 
19115 Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
19116 bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him
19117 nigh to his endless end.
19118 
19119 Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
19120 dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
19121 higher you rise the harder you toil.  So with poor Queequeg, who, as
19122 harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale,
19123 but--as we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back in a rolling sea;
19124 and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating
19125 all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
19126 clumsiest casks and see to their stowage.  To be short, among
19127 whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.
19128 
19129 Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
19130 have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there;
19131 where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was
19132 crawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted
19133 lizard at the bottom of a well.  And a well, or an ice-house, it
19134 somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the
19135 heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a
19136 fever; and at last, after some days' suffering, laid him in his
19137 hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death.  How he wasted
19138 and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed
19139 but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.  But as all else
19140 in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes,
19141 nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a
19142 strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you
19143 there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health
19144 in him which could not die, or be weakened.  And like circles on the
19145 water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed
19146 rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity.  An awe that
19147 cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
19148 waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld
19149 who were bystanders when Zoroaster died.  For whatever is truly
19150 wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.
19151 And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike
19152 impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the
19153 dead could adequately tell.  So that--let us say it again--no dying
19154 Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose
19155 mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as
19156 he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed
19157 gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean's invisible
19158 flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.
19159 
19160 Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
19161 what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
19162 asked.  He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day
19163 was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket
19164 he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the
19165 rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned
19166 that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark
19167 canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for
19168 it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a
19169 dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be
19170 floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they
19171 believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible
19172 horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue
19173 heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,
19174 that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
19175 according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
19176 death-devouring sharks.  No: he desired a canoe like those of
19177 Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like
19178 a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that
19179 involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.
19180 
19181 Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
19182 was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might
19183 include.  There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber
19184 aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the
19185 aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks
19186 the coffin was recommended to be made.  No sooner was the carpenter
19187 apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all
19188 the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the
19189 forecastle and took Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly
19190 chalking Queequeg's person as he shifted the rule.
19191 
19192 "Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now," ejaculated the Long Island
19193 sailor.
19194 
19195 Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and
19196 general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length
19197 the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting
19198 two notches at its extremities.  This done, he marshalled the planks
19199 and his tools, and to work.
19200 
19201 When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
19202 lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
19203 whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.
19204 
19205 Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the
19206 people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every
19207 one's consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly
19208 brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all
19209 mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since
19210 they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows
19211 ought to be indulged.
19212 
19213 Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with
19214 an attentive eye.  He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden
19215 stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin
19216 along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,
19217 also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of
19218 fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth
19219 scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being
19220 rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his
19221 final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.
19222 He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag
19223 and bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing his arms on his
19224 breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he
19225 called it) to be placed over him.  The head part turned over with a
19226 leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but
19227 his composed countenance in view.  "Rarmai" (it will do; it is easy),
19228 he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.
19229 
19230 But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
19231 this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings,
19232 took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
19233 
19234 "Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?
19235 where go ye now?  But if the currents carry ye to those sweet
19236 Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye
19237 do one little errand for me?  Seek out one Pip, who's now been
19238 missing long: I think he's in those far Antilles.  If ye find him,
19239 then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he's left his
19240 tambourine behind;--I found it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg,
19241 die; and I'll beat ye your dying march."
19242 
19243 "I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, "that in
19244 violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;
19245 and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in
19246 their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been
19247 really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars.  So, to my
19248 fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings
19249 heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.  Where learned he that,
19250 but there?--Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now."
19251 
19252 "Form two and two!  Let's make a General of him!  Ho, where's his
19253 harpoon?  Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza!  Oh for a
19254 game cock now to sit upon his head and crow!  Queequeg dies
19255 game!--mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!--take ye good heed of that;
19256 Queequeg dies game!  I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he
19257 died a coward; died all a'shiver;--out upon Pip!  Hark ye; if ye find
19258 Pip, tell all the Antilles he's a runaway; a coward, a coward, a
19259 coward!  Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat!  I'd never beat my
19260 tambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more
19261 dying here.  No, no! shame upon all cowards--shame upon them!  Let 'em
19262 go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat.  Shame! shame!"
19263 
19264 During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.
19265 Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
19266 
19267 But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
19268 that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;
19269 soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,
19270 when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,
19271 that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical
19272 moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was
19273 leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he
19274 could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live
19275 or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He
19276 answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a
19277 man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:
19278 nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
19279 unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
19280 
19281 Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and
19282 civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months
19283 convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well
19284 again in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at
19285 length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but
19286 eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,
19287 threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned
19288 a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,
19289 and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.
19290 
19291 With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
19292 emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
19293 Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
19294 grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
19295 striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
19296 his body.  And this tattooing had been the work of a departed
19297 prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had
19298 written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the
19299 earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that
19300 Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous
19301 work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read,
19302 though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were
19303 therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living
19304 parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
19305 last.  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab
19306 that wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from
19307 surveying poor Queequeg--"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!"
19308

19311 CHAPTER 111
19312 
19313 The Pacific.
19314 
19315 
19316 When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
19317 South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear
19318 Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my
19319 youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
19320 thousand leagues of blue.
19321 
19322 There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose
19323 gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath;
19324 like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried
19325 Evangelist St. John.  And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures,
19326 wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters' Fields of all four
19327 continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow
19328 unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned
19329 dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls,
19330 lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds;
19331 the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.
19332 
19333 To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld,
19334 must ever after be the sea of his adoption.  It rolls the midmost
19335 waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its
19336 arms.  The same waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian
19337 towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave
19338 the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than
19339 Abraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and
19340 low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans.
19341 Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world's whole bulk
19342 about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart
19343 of earth.  Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the
19344 seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
19345 
19346 But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing like an
19347 iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with
19348 one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee
19349 isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with
19350 the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea;
19351 that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming.
19352 Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding
19353 towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man's purpose
19354 intensified itself.  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the
19355 Delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his
19356 very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, "Stern all!
19357 the White Whale spouts thick blood!"
19358 
19359 
19360 
19361 CHAPTER 112
19362 
19363 The Blacksmith.
19364 
19365 
19366 Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned
19367 in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active
19368 pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered
19369 old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again,
19370 after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still
19371 retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being
19372 now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and
19373 bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or
19374 new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture.  Often he would
19375 be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding
19376 boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching
19377 his every sooty movement, as he toiled.  Nevertheless, this old man's
19378 was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm.  No murmur, no
19379 impatience, no petulance did come from him.  Silent, slow, and
19380 solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he
19381 toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of
19382 his hammer the heavy beating of his heart.  And so it was.--Most
19383 miserable!
19384 
19385 A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful
19386 appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage
19387 excited the curiosity of the mariners.  And to the importunity of
19388 their persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came
19389 to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched
19390 fate.
19391 
19392 Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the
19393 road running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly
19394 felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a
19395 leaning, dilapidated barn.  The issue was, the loss of the
19396 extremities of both feet.  Out of this revelation, part by part, at
19397 last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as
19398 yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama.
19399 
19400 He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
19401 encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin.  He had
19402 been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a
19403 house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife,
19404 and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a
19405 cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove.  But one night, under
19406 cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning
19407 disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and
19408 robbed them all of everything.  And darker yet to tell, the
19409 blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his
19410 family's heart.  It was the Bottle Conjuror!  Upon the opening of
19411 that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home.
19412 Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's
19413 shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate
19414 entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife
19415 listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to
19416 the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose
19417 reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came
19418 up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's
19419 iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber.
19420 
19421 Oh, woe on woe!  Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
19422 Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin
19423 came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and
19424 her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their
19425 after years; and all of them a care-killing competency.  But Death
19426 plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily
19427 toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left
19428 the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life
19429 should make him easier to harvest.
19430 
19431 Why tell the whole?  The blows of the basement hammer every day grew
19432 more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the
19433 last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
19434 glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the
19435 bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold;
19436 the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children
19437 twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man
19438 staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his
19439 grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!
19440 
19441 Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but
19442 Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it
19443 is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense
19444 Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the
19445 death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some
19446 interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and
19447 all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of
19448 unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and
19449 from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to
19450 them--"Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the
19451 guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without
19452 dying for them.  Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your
19453 now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious
19454 than death.  Come hither! put up THY gravestone, too, within the
19455 churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!"
19456 
19457 Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by
19458 fall of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come!  And so
19459 Perth went a-whaling.
19460 
19461 
19462 
19463 CHAPTER 113
19464 
19465 The Forge.
19466 
19467 
19468 With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
19469 mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
19470 placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in
19471 the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab
19472 came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag.
19473 While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till
19474 at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering
19475 it upon the anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick
19476 hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.
19477 
19478 "Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying
19479 in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here,
19480 they burn; but thou--thou liv'st among them without a scorch."
19481 
19482 "Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth,
19483 resting for a moment on his hammer; "I am past scorching; not easily
19484 can'st thou scorch a scar."
19485 
19486 "Well, well; no more.  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely
19487 woeful to me.  In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in
19488 others that is not mad.  Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why
19489 dost thou not go mad?  How can'st thou endure without being mad?  Do
19490 the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--What wert
19491 thou making there?"
19492 
19493 "Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it."
19494 
19495 "And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such
19496 hard usage as it had?"
19497 
19498 "I think so, sir."
19499 
19500 "And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never
19501 mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"
19502 
19503 "Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one."
19504 
19505 "Look ye here, then," cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
19506 with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look ye here--HERE--can ye
19507 smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across
19508 his ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I
19509 lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my
19510 eyes.  Answer!  Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"
19511 
19512 "Oh! that is the one, sir!  Said I not all seams and dents but one?"
19513 
19514 "Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
19515 though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
19516 the bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles!  But, away with child's
19517 play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day.  Look ye here!" jingling the
19518 leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins.  "I, too, want a
19519 harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part,
19520 Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.
19521 There's the stuff," flinging the pouch upon the anvil.  "Look ye,
19522 blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of
19523 racing horses."
19524 
19525 "Horse-shoe stubbs, sir?  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then,
19526 the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work."
19527 
19528 "I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from
19529 the melted bones of murderers.  Quick! forge me the harpoon.  And
19530 forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and
19531 hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a
19532 tow-line.  Quick!  I'll blow the fire."
19533 
19534 When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one,
19535 by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt.
19536 "A flaw!" rejecting the last one.  "Work that over again, Perth."
19537 
19538 This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
19539 Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.  As, then,
19540 with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing
19541 to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed
19542 forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed
19543 silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking
19544 some curse or some blessing on the toil.  But, as Ahab looked up, he
19545 slid aside.
19546 
19547 "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" muttered
19548 Stubb, looking on from the forecastle.  "That Parsee smells fire like
19549 a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan."
19550 
19551 At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and
19552 as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water
19553 near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.
19554 
19555 "Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain;
19556 "have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?"
19557 
19558 "Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.  Is not this
19559 harpoon for the White Whale?"
19560 
19561 "For the white fiend!  But now for the barbs; thou must make them
19562 thyself, man.  Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make
19563 the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."
19564 
19565 For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
19566 fain not use them.
19567 
19568 "Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave,
19569 sup, nor pray till--but here--to work!"
19570 
19571 Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
19572 shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
19573 blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to
19574 tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
19575 
19576 "No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.
19577 Ahoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will
19578 ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high
19579 up.  A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.  Three punctures were made
19580 in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.
19581 
19582 "Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!"
19583 deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured
19584 the baptismal blood.
19585 
19586 Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of
19587 hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
19588 socket of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and
19589 some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great
19590 tension.  Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a
19591 harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings,
19592 Ahab exclaimed, "Good! and now for the seizings."
19593 
19594 At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread
19595 yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the
19596 pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the
19597 rope was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured
19598 so, with intertwistings of twine.  This done, pole, iron, and
19599 rope--like the Three Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily
19600 stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the
19601 sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.
19602 But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet
19603 most piteous sound was heard.  Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy
19604 idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly
19605 blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!
19606 
19607 
19608 
19609 CHAPTER 114
19610 
19611 The Gilder.
19612 
19613 
19614 Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese
19615 cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.
19616 Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and
19617 twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily
19618 pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an
19619 interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising;
19620 though with but small success for their pains.
19621 
19622 At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
19623 heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
19624 sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like
19625 hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times
19626 of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy
19627 of the ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath
19628 it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but
19629 conceals a remorseless fang.
19630 
19631 These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
19632 certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
19633 regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
19634 only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through
19635 high rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie:
19636 as when the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears,
19637 while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
19638 
19639 The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
19640 there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
19641 children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
19642 the flowers of the woods are plucked.  And all this mixes with your
19643 most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting,
19644 interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.
19645 
19646 Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
19647 temporary an effect on Ahab.  But if these secret golden keys did
19648 seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his
19649 breath upon them prove but tarnishing.
19650 
19651 Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
19652 ye,--though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy
19653 life,--in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning
19654 clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the
19655 life immortal on them.  Would to God these blessed calms would last.
19656 But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof:
19657 calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.  There is no steady
19658 unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed
19659 gradations, and at the last one pause:--through infancy's unconscious
19660 spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common
19661 doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's
19662 pondering repose of If.  But once gone through, we trace the round
19663 again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally.  Where lies
19664 the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?  In what rapt ether sails
19665 the world, of which the weariest will never weary?  Where is the
19666 foundling's father hidden?  Our souls are like those orphans whose
19667 unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity
19668 lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.
19669 
19670 And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into
19671 that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--
19672 
19673 "Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's
19674 eye!--Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
19675 cannibal ways.  Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look
19676 deep down and do believe."
19677 
19678 And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
19679 golden light:--
19680 
19681 "I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths
19682 that he has always been jolly!"
19683 
19684 
19685 
19686 CHAPTER 115
19687 
19688 The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.
19689 
19690 
19691 And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing
19692 down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been
19693 welded.
19694 
19695 It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
19696 last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
19697 glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
19698 sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground,
19699 previous to pointing her prow for home.
19700 
19701 The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
19702 bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
19703 bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
19704 lower jaw of the last whale they had slain.  Signals, ensigns, and
19705 jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side.
19706 Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels
19707 of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender
19708 breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was
19709 a brazen lamp.
19710 
19711 As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most
19712 surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising
19713 in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months
19714 without securing a single fish.  Not only had barrels of beef and
19715 bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm,
19716 but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the
19717 ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the
19718 captain's and officers' state-rooms.  Even the cabin table itself
19719 had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the
19720 broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a
19721 centrepiece.  In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked
19722 and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added,
19723 that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled
19724 it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;
19725 that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled
19726 them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the
19727 captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his
19728 hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.
19729 
19730 As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
19731 barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and
19732 drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her
19733 huge try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach
19734 skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the
19735 clenched hands of the crew.  On the quarter-deck, the mates and
19736 harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped
19737 with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an
19738 ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and
19739 mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of
19740 whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig.  Meanwhile,
19741 others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of
19742 the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed.  You would
19743 have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such
19744 wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were
19745 being hurled into the sea.
19746 
19747 Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
19748 ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
19749 full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
19750 diversion.
19751 
19752 And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
19753 with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other's
19754 wakes--one all jubilations for things passed, the other all
19755 forebodings as to things to come--their two captains in themselves
19756 impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.
19757 
19758 "Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander,
19759 lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.
19760 
19761 "Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.
19762 
19763 "No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all," said the
19764 other good-humoredly.  "Come aboard!"
19765 
19766 "Thou art too damned jolly.  Sail on.  Hast lost any men?"
19767 
19768 "Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,
19769 old hearty, come along.  I'll soon take that black from your brow.
19770 Come along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and
19771 homeward-bound."
19772 
19773 "How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then aloud, "Thou
19774 art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me
19775 an empty ship, and outward-bound.  So go thy ways, and I will mine.
19776 Forward there!  Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!"
19777 
19778 And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the
19779 other stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted;
19780 the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards
19781 the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their
19782 gaze for the lively revelry they were in.  And as Ahab, leaning over
19783 the taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a
19784 small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial,
19785 seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that
19786 vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.

19792 The Dying Whale.
19793 
19794 
19795 Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favourites
19796 sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
19797 rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.  So
19798 seemed it with the Pequod.  For next day after encountering the gay
19799 Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by
19800 Ahab.
19801 
19802 It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the
19803 crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and
19804 sky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness
19805 and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that
19806 rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green
19807 convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze,
19808 wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper
19809 hymns.
19810 
19811 Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had
19812 sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings
19813 from the now tranquil boat.  For that strange spectacle observable in
19814 all sperm whales dying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so
19815 expiring--that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening,
19816 somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
19817 
19818 "He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
19819 homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.  He
19820 too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the
19821 sun!--Oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring
19822 sights.  Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal
19823 or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions
19824 no rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows
19825 have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine
19826 upon the Niger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full
19827 of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the
19828 corpse, and it heads some other way.
19829 
19830 "Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast
19831 builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these
19832 unverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly
19833 speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed
19834 burial of its after calm.  Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his
19835 dying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to me.
19836 
19837 "Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power!  Oh, high aspiring,
19838 rainbowed jet!--that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain!  In
19839 vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
19840 sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again.  Yet dost
19841 thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.  All
19842 thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by
19843 breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.
19844 
19845 "Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
19846 fowl finds his only rest.  Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;
19847 though hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my
19848 foster-brothers!"

19852 CHAPTER 117
19853 
19854 The Whale Watch.
19855 
19856 
19857 The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
19858 windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern.
19859 These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the
19860 windward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had
19861 killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.
19862 
19863 The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole;
19864 and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering
19865 glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight
19866 waves, which gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf
19867 upon a beach.
19868 
19869 Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who
19870 crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
19871 round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.
19872 A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
19873 ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
19874 
19875 Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
19876 hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
19877 flooded world.  "I have dreamed it again," said he.
19878 
19879 "Of the hearses?  Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
19880 coffin can be thine?"
19881 
19882 "And who are hearsed that die on the sea?"
19883 
19884 "But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
19885 hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
19886 mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
19887 America."
19888 
19889 "Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its plumes
19890 floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers.  Ha!
19891 Such a sight we shall not soon see."
19892 
19893 "Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man."
19894 
19895 "And what was that saying about thyself?"
19896 
19897 "Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot."
19898 
19899 "And when thou art so gone before--if that ever befall--then ere I
19900 can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--Was it
19901 not so?  Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!  I have
19902 here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."
19903 
19904 "Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted
19905 up like fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee."
19906 
19907 "The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea,"
19908 cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;--"Immortal on land and on sea!"
19909 
19910 Both were silent again, as one man.  The grey dawn came on, and the
19911 slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the dead
19912 whale was brought to the ship.
19913 
19914 
19915 
19916 CHAPTER 118
19917 
19918 The Quadrant.
19919 
19920 
19921 The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
19922 coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman
19923 would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners
19924 quickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes
19925 centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to
19926 point the ship's prow for the equator.  In good time the order came.
19927 It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his
19928 high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of
19929 the sun to determine his latitude.
19930 
19931 Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
19932 effulgences.  That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
19933 focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass.  The sky
19934 looks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this
19935 nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
19936 God's throne.  Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured
19937 glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire.  So,
19938 swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his
19939 astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in
19940 that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the
19941 sun should gain its precise meridian.  Meantime while his whole
19942 attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the
19943 ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing the same
19944 sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and
19945 his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.  At length
19946 the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory
19947 leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise
19948 instant.  Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked up
19949 towards the sun and murmured to himself: "Thou sea-mark! thou high
19950 and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou
19951 cast the least hint where I SHALL be?  Or canst thou tell where some
19952 other thing besides me is this moment living?  Where is Moby Dick?
19953 This instant thou must be eyeing him.  These eyes of mine look into
19954 the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye
19955 that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,
19956 thither side of thee, thou sun!"
19957 
19958 Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
19959 numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
19960 "Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
19961 and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but
19962 what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
19963 thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
19964 holds thee: no! not one jot more!  Thou canst not tell where one drop
19965 of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with
19966 thy impotence thou insultest the sun!  Science!  Curse thee, thou
19967 vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to
19968 that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes
19969 are even now scorched with thy light, O sun!  Level by nature to this
19970 earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes; not shot from the
19971 crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.
19972 Curse thee, thou quadrant!" dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I
19973 guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship's compass, and the level
19974 deadreckoning, by log and by line; THESE shall conduct me, and show
19975 me my place on the sea.  Aye," lighting from the boat to the deck,
19976 "thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on
19977 high; thus I split and destroy thee!"
19978 
19979 As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
19980 dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
19981 fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed over
19982 the mute, motionless Parsee's face.  Unobserved he rose and glided
19983 away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen
19984 clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing
19985 the deck, shouted out--"To the braces!  Up helm!--square in!"
19986 
19987 In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled
19988 upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised
19989 upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting
19990 on one sufficient steed.
19991 
19992 Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's
19993 tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went lurching along the deck.
19994 
19995 "I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
19996 of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,
19997 down, to dumbest dust.  Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
19998 thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!"
19999 
20000 "Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr.
20001 Starbuck--sea-coal, not your common charcoal.  Well, well; I heard
20002 Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands
20003 of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.'  And damn me,
20004 Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!"
20005 
20006 
20007 
20008 CHAPTER 119
20009 
20010 The Candles.
20011 
20012 
20013 Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
20014 crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.  Skies the most
20015 effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
20016 tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.  So, too, it is, that
20017 in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst
20018 of all storms, the Typhoon.  It will sometimes burst from out that
20019 cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.
20020 
20021 Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
20022 bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
20023 ahead.  When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
20024 thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled
20025 masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of
20026 the tempest had left for its after sport.
20027 
20028 Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
20029 every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
20030 disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
20031 and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
20032 lashing of the boats.  But all their pains seemed naught.  Though
20033 lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat
20034 (Ahab's) did not escape.  A great rolling sea, dashing high up
20035 against the reeling ship's high teetering side, stove in the boat's
20036 bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a
20037 sieve.
20038 
20039 "Bad work, bad work!  Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
20040 "but the sea will have its way.  Stubb, for one, can't fight it.  You
20041 see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it
20042 leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring!  But
20043 as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck
20044 here.  But never mind; it's all in fun: so the old song
20045 says;"--(SINGS.)
20046 
20047 Oh! jolly is the gale,
20048 And a joker is the whale,
20049 A' flourishin' his tail,--
20050 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
20051 
20052 The scud all a flyin',
20053 That's his flip only foamin';
20054 When he stirs in the spicin',--
20055 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
20056 
20057 Thunder splits the ships,
20058 But he only smacks his lips,
20059 A tastin' of this flip,--
20060 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
20061 
20062 
20063 "Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "let the Typhoon sing, and strike his
20064 harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
20065 thy peace."
20066 
20067 "But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a
20068 coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits.  And I tell you what it is,
20069 Mr. Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to
20070 cut my throat.  And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the
20071 doxology for a wind-up."
20072 
20073 "Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own."
20074 
20075 "What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else,
20076 never mind how foolish?"
20077 
20078 "Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing
20079 his hand towards the weather bow, "markest thou not that the gale
20080 comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby
20081 Dick? the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat
20082 there; where is that stove?  In the stern-sheets, man; where he is
20083 wont to stand--his stand-point is stove, man!  Now jump overboard,
20084 and sing away, if thou must!
20085 
20086 "I don't half understand ye: what's in the wind?"
20087 
20088 "Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to
20089 Nantucket," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb's
20090 question.  "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn
20091 it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home.  Yonder, to
20092 windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see
20093 it lightens up there; but not with the lightning."
20094 
20095 At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,
20096 following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at
20097 the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
20098 
20099 "Who's there?"
20100 
20101 "Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
20102 pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by
20103 elbowed lances of fire.
20104 
20105 Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry
20106 off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea
20107 some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the
20108 water.  But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,
20109 that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if
20110 kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,
20111 besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more
20112 or less impeding the vessel's way in the water; because of all this,
20113 the lower parts of a ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard;
20114 but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more
20115 readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the
20116 sea, as occasion may require.
20117 
20118 "The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
20119 to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
20120 flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post.  "Are they overboard? drop them
20121 over, fore and aft.  Quick!"
20122 
20123 "Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be the
20124 weaker side.  Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
20125 Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges!  Let
20126 them be, sir."
20127 
20128 "Look aloft!" cried Starbuck.  "The corpusants! the corpusants!
20129 
20130 All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
20131 tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each
20132 of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air,
20133 like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
20134 
20135 "Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant, as a
20136 swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its
20137 gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.
20138 "Blast it!"--but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes
20139 caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried--"The
20140 corpusants have mercy on us all!"
20141 
20142 To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance
20143 of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate
20144 curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a
20145 seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common
20146 oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His
20147 "Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin" has been woven into the shrouds and the
20148 cordage.
20149 
20150 While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from
20151 the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,
20152 all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
20153 constellation of stars.  Relieved against the ghostly light, the
20154 gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
20155 seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.  The parted
20156 mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
20157 gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
20158 the preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic
20159 blue flames on his body.
20160 
20161 The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once
20162 more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.
20163 A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against
20164 some one.  It was Stubb.  "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy
20165 cry; it was not the same in the song."
20166 
20167 "No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
20168 hope they will, still.  But do they only have mercy on long
20169 faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh?  And look ye, Mr.
20170 Starbuck--but it's too dark to look.  Hear me, then: I take that
20171 mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are
20172 rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil,
20173 d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like
20174 sap in a tree.  Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti
20175 candles--that's the good promise we saw."
20176 
20177 At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning
20178 to glimmer into sight.  Glancing upwards, he cried: "See! see!" and
20179 once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed
20180 redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.
20181 
20182 "The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.
20183 
20184 At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the
20185 flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head
20186 bowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging
20187 rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number
20188 of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung
20189 pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig.
20190 In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or
20191 running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck;
20192 but all their eyes upcast.
20193 
20194 "Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab.  "Look up at it; mark it well; the white
20195 flame but lights the way to the White Whale!  Hand me those mainmast
20196 links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against
20197 it; blood against fire!  So."
20198 
20199 Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his
20200 foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right
20201 arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
20202 
20203 "Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
20204 once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that
20205 to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and
20206 I now know that thy right worship is defiance.  To neither love nor
20207 reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill;
20208 and all are killed.  No fearless fool now fronts thee.  I own thy
20209 speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake
20210 life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.  In the
20211 midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.
20212 Though but a point at best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go;
20213 yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and
20214 feels her royal rights.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.  Come in
20215 thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy
20216 highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest
20217 navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in here that still
20218 remains indifferent.  Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest
20219 me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee."
20220 
20221 [SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP
20222 LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST,
20223 CLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]
20224 
20225 "I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?  Nor was it
20226 wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.  Thou canst blind; but
20227 I can then grope.  Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes.  Take
20228 the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.  I would not take
20229 it.  The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and
20230 ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some
20231 stunning ground.  Oh, oh!  Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.
20232 Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness
20233 leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!  The javelins cease; open
20234 eyes; see, or not?  There burn the flames!  Oh, thou magnanimous! now
20235 I do glory in my genealogy.  But thou art but my fiery father; my
20236 sweet mother, I know not.  Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her?
20237 There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.  Thou knowest not how
20238 came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy
20239 beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.  I know that of me, which
20240 thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.  There is some
20241 unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy
20242 eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.  Through thee,
20243 thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.  Oh, thou
20244 foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy
20245 incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.  Here again with
20246 haughty agony, I read my sire.  Leap! leap up, and lick the sky!  I
20247 leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee;
20248 defyingly I worship thee!"
20249 
20250 "The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"
20251 
20252 Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly
20253 lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his
20254 whale-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused
20255 the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb
20256 there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire.  As the silent
20257 harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab
20258 by the arm--"God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an
20259 ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while
20260 we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a
20261 better voyage than this."
20262 
20263 Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
20264 braces--though not a sail was left aloft.  For the moment all the
20265 aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous
20266 cry.  But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and
20267 snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them;
20268 swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a
20269 rope's end.  Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from
20270 the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab
20271 again spoke:--
20272 
20273 "All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
20274 heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.  And that
20275 ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow
20276 out the last fear!"  And with one blast of his breath he extinguished
20277 the flame.
20278 
20279 As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood
20280 of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render
20281 it so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for
20282 thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners
20283 did run from him in a terror of dismay.

20294 We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir.  The band is working

20296 
20297 "Strike nothing; lash it.  If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway them up
20298 now."
20299 
20300 "Sir!--in God's name!--sir?"
20301 
20302 "Well."
20303 
20304 "The anchors are working, sir.  Shall I get them inboard?"
20305 
20306 "Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything.  The wind
20307 rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet.  Quick, and see
20308 to it.--By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper
20309 of some coasting smack.  Send down my main-top-sail yard!  Ho,
20310 gluepots!  Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this
20311 brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud.  Shall I strike
20312 that?  Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest
20313 time.  What a hooroosh aloft there!  I would e'en take it for
20314 sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady.  Oh, take
20315 medicine, take medicine!"

20324 STUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM, AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER
20325 THE ANCHORS THERE HANGING.
20326 
20327 
20328 No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
20329 you will never pound into me what you were just now saying.  And how
20330 long ago is it since you said the very contrary?  Didn't you once say
20331 that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something
20332 extra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with
20333 powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward?  Stop, now; didn't
20334 you say so?"
20335 
20336 "Well, suppose I did?  What then?  I've part changed my flesh since
20337 that time, why not my mind?  Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with
20338 powder barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the
20339 lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here?  Why, my little man,
20340 you have pretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now.  Shake
20341 yourself; you're Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill
20342 pitchers at your coat collar.  Don't you see, then, that for these
20343 extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?
20344 Here are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, again, and I'll answer ye the
20345 other thing.  First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor
20346 here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen.  What's the mighty
20347 difference between holding a mast's lightning-rod in the storm, and
20348 standing close by a mast that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in
20349 a storm?  Don't you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to
20350 the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?  What are you
20351 talking about, then?  Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and
20352 Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more danger then, in my
20353 poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing
20354 the seas.  Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every
20355 man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the
20356 corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather, and
20357 trailing behind like his sash.  Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's
20358 easy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can
20359 be sensible."
20360 
20361 "I don't know that, Stubb.  You sometimes find it rather hard."
20362 
20363 "Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible,
20364 that's a fact.  And I am about drenched with this spray.  Never mind;
20365 catch the turn there, and pass it.  Seems to me we are lashing down
20366 these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.
20367 Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands
20368 behind him.  And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.  These
20369 are your iron fists, hey?  What a hold they have, too!  I wonder,
20370 Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings
20371 with an uncommon long cable, though.  There, hammer that knot down,
20372 and we've done.  So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is the
20373 most satisfactory.  I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?
20374 Thank ye.  They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a
20375 Long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.  The
20376 tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d'ye see.
20377 Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask.
20378 No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a
20379 swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so.  Halloa! whew! there goes
20380 my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from
20381 heaven should be so unmannerly!  This is a nasty night, lad."

20400 
20401 The Musket.
20402 
20403 
20404 During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the
20405 Pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to
20406 the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had
20407 been attached to it--for they were slack--because some play to the
20408 tiller was indispensable.
20409 
20410 In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed
20411 shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the
20412 needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.  It was
20413 thus with the Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman had not
20414 failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon
20415 the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some
20416 sort of unwonted emotion.
20417 
20418 Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through
20419 the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged forward
20420 and the other aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and
20421 main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away
20422 to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are
20423 cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
20424 
20425 The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
20426 storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
20427 the water with some precision again; and the course--for the present,
20428 East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
20429 given to the helmsman.  For during the violence of the gale, he had
20430 only steered according to its vicissitudes.  But as he was now
20431 bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the
20432 compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round
20433 astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!
20434 
20435 Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of "HO! THE FAIR
20436 WIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN!" the crew singing for joy, that so
20437 promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
20438 preceding it.
20439 
20440 In compliance with the standing order of his commander--to report
20441 immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided
20442 change in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had no sooner trimmed
20443 the yards to the breeze--however reluctantly and gloomily,--than he
20444 mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
20445 
20446 Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
20447 moment.  The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--was
20448 burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's
20449 bolted door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of
20450 upper panels.  The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a
20451 certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by
20452 all the roar of the elements.  The loaded muskets in the rack were
20453 shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward
20454 bulkhead.  Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck's
20455 heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely
20456 evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good
20457 accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.
20458 
20459 "He would have shot me once," he murmured, "yes, there's the very
20460 musket that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock; let
20461 me touch it--lift it.  Strange, that I, who have handled so many
20462 deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now.  Loaded?  I must
20463 see.  Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;--that's not good.  Best spill
20464 it?--wait.  I'll cure myself of this.  I'll hold the musket boldly
20465 while I think.--I come to report a fair wind to him.  But how fair?
20466 Fair for death and doom,--THAT'S fair for Moby Dick.  It's a fair
20467 wind that's only fair for that accursed fish.--The very tube he
20468 pointed at me!--the very one; THIS one--I hold it here; he would have
20469 killed me with the very thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain
20470 kill all his crew.  Does he not say he will not strike his spars to
20471 any gale?  Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same
20472 perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the
20473 error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that
20474 he would have no lightning-rods?  But shall this crazed old man be
20475 tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with
20476 him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and
20477 more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm,
20478 my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way.  If, then, he
20479 were this instant--put aside, that crime would not be his.  Ha! is he
20480 muttering in his sleep?  Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping.
20481 Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again.  I can't
20482 withstand thee, then, old man.  Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not
20483 entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest.  Flat
20484 obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest.  Aye,
20485 and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs.
20486 Great God forbid!--But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make
20487 him a prisoner to be taken home?  What! hope to wrest this old man's
20488 living power from his own living hands?  Only a fool would try it.
20489 Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;
20490 chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more
20491 hideous than a caged tiger, then.  I could not endure the sight;
20492 could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,
20493 inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage.
20494 What, then, remains?  The land is hundreds of leagues away, and
20495 locked Japan the nearest.  I stand alone here upon an open sea, with
20496 two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis
20497 so.--Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be
20498 murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?--And would I
20499 be a murderer, then, if"--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways
20500 looking, he placed the loaded musket's end against the door.
20501 
20502 "On this level, Ahab's hammock swings within; his head this way.  A
20503 touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--Oh
20504 Mary!  Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, old
20505 man, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body this day
20506 week may sink, with all the crew!  Great God, where art Thou?  Shall
20507 I? shall I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and
20508 main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course."
20509 
20510 "Stern all!  Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!"
20511 
20512 Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's
20513 tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb
20514 dream to speak.
20515 
20516 The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the
20517 panel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the
20518 door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
20519 
20520 "He's too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and
20521 tell him.  I must see to the deck here.  Thou know'st what to say."
20522 
20523 
20524 
20525 CHAPTER 124
20526 
20527 The Needle.
20528 
20529 
20530 Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
20531 mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her
20532 on like giants' palms outspread.  The strong, unstaggering breeze
20533 abounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the
20534 whole world boomed before the wind.  Muffled in the full morning
20535 light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of
20536 his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.  Emblazonings,
20537 as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.
20538 The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with
20539 light and heat.
20540 
20541 Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every
20542 time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he
20543 turned to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead; and when she
20544 profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun's
20545 rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his
20546 undeviating wake.
20547 
20548 "Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
20549 of the sun.  Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun
20550 to ye!  Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the
20551 sea!"
20552 
20553 But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
20554 the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
20555 
20556 "East-sou-east, sir," said the frightened steersman.
20557 
20558 "Thou liest!" smiting him with his clenched fist.  "Heading East at
20559 this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?"
20560 
20561 Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
20562 observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its
20563 very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
20564 
20565 Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one
20566 glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment
20567 he almost seemed to stagger.  Standing behind him Starbuck looked,
20568 and lo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as
20569 infallibly going West.
20570 
20571 But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
20572 old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I have it!  It has happened
20573 before.  Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our
20574 compasses--that's all.  Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I
20575 take it."
20576 
20577 "Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir," said the pale
20578 mate, gloomily.
20579 
20580 Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more
20581 than one case occurred to ships in violent storms.  The magnetic
20582 energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know,
20583 essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is
20584 not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be.  Instances
20585 where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite
20586 down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at
20587 times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being
20588 annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use
20589 than an old wife's knitting needle.  But in either case, the needle
20590 never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or
20591 lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate
20592 reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the
20593 lowermost one inserted into the kelson.
20594 
20595 Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the
20596 transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended
20597 hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the
20598 needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship's
20599 course to be changed accordingly.  The yards were hard up; and once
20600 more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for
20601 the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.
20602 
20603 Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
20604 nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
20605 Flask--who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
20606 feelings--likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.  As for the men, though
20607 some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their
20608 fear of Fate.  But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained
20609 almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a
20610 certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible
20611 Ahab's.
20612 
20613 For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.  But
20614 chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
20615 sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
20616 
20617 "Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I wrecked
20618 thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me.  So, so.
20619 But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet.  Mr. Starbuck--a lance
20620 without a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker's
20621 needles.  Quick!"
20622 
20623 Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now
20624 about to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have
20625 been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile
20626 skill, in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.
20627 Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles,
20628 though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by
20629 superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.
20630 
20631 "Men," said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed
20632 him the things he had demanded, "my men, the thunder turned old
20633 Ahab's needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his
20634 own, that will point as true as any."
20635 
20636 Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as
20637 this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
20638 might follow.  But Starbuck looked away.
20639 
20640 With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
20641 lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
20642 him hold it upright, without its touching the deck.  Then, with the
20643 maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he
20644 placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly
20645 hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as
20646 before.  Then going through some small strange motions with
20647 it--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely
20648 intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain--he called for
20649 linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two
20650 reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by
20651 its middle, over one of the compass-cards.  At first, the steel went
20652 round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last
20653 it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching
20654 for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing
20655 his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--"Look ye, for yourselves,
20656 if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone!  The sun is East, and
20657 that compass swears it!"
20658 
20659 One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes
20660 could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they
20661 slunk away.
20662 
20663 In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
20664 fatal pride.
20665 
20666 
20667 
20668 CHAPTER 125
20669 
20670 The Log and Line.
20671 
20672 
20673 While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the
20674 log and line had but very seldom been in use.  Owing to a confident
20675 reliance upon other means of determining the vessel's place, some
20676 merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly
20677 neglect to heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently
20678 more for form's sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon
20679 the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the
20680 presumed average rate of progression every hour.  It had been thus
20681 with the Pequod.  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long
20682 untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.  Rains and
20683 spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all the elements
20684 had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.  But heedless of all
20685 this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,
20686 not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his
20687 quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level
20688 log and line.  The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows
20689 rolled in riots.
20690 
20691 "Forward, there!  Heave the log!"
20692 
20693 Two seamen came.  The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
20694 "Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."
20695 
20696 They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where
20697 the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping
20698 into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
20699 
20700 The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
20701 handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved,
20702 so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced
20703 to him.
20704 
20705 Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
20706 turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
20707 Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
20708 speak.
20709 
20710 "Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
20711 spoiled it."
20712 
20713 "'Twill hold, old gentleman.  Long heat and wet, have they spoiled
20714 thee?  Thou seem'st to hold.  Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee;
20715 not thou it."
20716 
20717 "I hold the spool, sir.  But just as my captain says.  With these
20718 grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a
20719 superior, who'll ne'er confess."
20720 
20721 "What's that?  There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's
20722 granite-founded College; but methinks he's too subservient.  Where
20723 wert thou born?"
20724 
20725 "In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir."
20726 
20727 "Excellent!  Thou'st hit the world by that."
20728 
20729 "I know not, sir, but I was born there."
20730 
20731 "In the Isle of Man, hey?  Well, the other way, it's good.  Here's a
20732 man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of
20733 Man; which is sucked in--by what?  Up with the reel!  The dead, blind
20734 wall butts all inquiring heads at last.  Up with it!  So."
20735 
20736 The log was heaved.  The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a
20737 long dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to
20738 whirl.  In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows,
20739 the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger
20740 strangely.
20741 
20742 "Hold hard!"
20743 
20744 Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
20745 tugging log was gone.
20746 
20747 "I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
20748 sea parts the log-line.  But Ahab can mend all.  Haul in here,
20749 Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.  And look ye, let the carpenter make
20750 another log, and mend thou the line.  See to it."
20751 
20752 "There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewer
20753 seems loosening out of the middle of the world.  Haul in, haul in,
20754 Tahitian!  These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken,
20755 and dragging slow.  Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?"
20756 
20757 "Pip? whom call ye Pip?  Pip jumped from the whale-boat.  Pip's
20758 missing.  Let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here, fisherman.
20759 It drags hard; I guess he's holding on.  Jerk him, Tahiti!  Jerk him
20760 off; we haul in no cowards here.  Ho! there's his arm just breaking
20761 water.  A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards here.
20762 Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here's Pip, trying to get on board again."
20763 
20764 "Peace, thou crazy loon," cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
20765 "Away from the quarter-deck!"
20766 
20767 "The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser," muttered Ahab, advancing.
20768 "Hands off from that holiness!  Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
20769 
20770 "Astern there, sir, astern!  Lo! lo!"
20771 
20772 "And who art thou, boy?  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils
20773 of thy eyes.  Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls
20774 to sieve through!  Who art thou, boy?"
20775 
20776 "Bell-boy, sir; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One
20777 hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high--looks
20778 cowardly--quickest known by that!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip
20779 the coward?"
20780 
20781 "There can be no hearts above the snow-line.  Oh, ye frozen heavens!
20782 look down here.  Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
20783 him, ye creative libertines.  Here, boy; Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's
20784 home henceforth, while Ahab lives.  Thou touchest my inmost centre,
20785 boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings.  Come,
20786 let's down."
20787 
20788 "What's this? here's velvet shark-skin," intently gazing at Ahab's
20789 hand, and feeling it.  "Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a
20790 thing as this, perhaps he had ne'er been lost!  This seems to me,
20791 sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by.  Oh, sir,
20792 let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black
20793 one with the white, for I will not let this go."
20794 
20795 "Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
20796 horrors than are here.  Come, then, to my cabin.  Lo! ye believers in
20797 gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient
20798 gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing
20799 not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude.
20800 Come!  I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I
20801 grasped an Emperor's!"
20802 
20803 "There go two daft ones now," muttered the old Manxman.  "One daft
20804 with strength, the other daft with weakness.  But here's the end of
20805 the rotten line--all dripping, too.  Mend it, eh?  I think we had
20806 best have a new line altogether.  I'll see Mr. Stubb about it."
20807 
20808 
20809 
20810 CHAPTER 126
20811 
20812 The Life-Buoy.
20813 
20814 
20815 Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her
20816 progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod
20817 held on her path towards the Equator.  Making so long a passage
20818 through such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long,
20819 sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously
20820 mild; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous
20821 and desperate scene.
20822 
20823 At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
20824 Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before
20825 the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then
20826 headed by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
20827 unearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all
20828 Herod's murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started from their
20829 reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned
20830 all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that
20831 wild cry remained within hearing.  The Christian or civilized part of
20832 the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan
20833 harpooneers remained unappalled.  Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest
20834 mariner of all--declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were
20835 heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.
20836 
20837 Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when
20838 he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
20839 unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings.  He hollowly laughed, and
20840 thus explained the wonder.
20841 
20842 Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great
20843 numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or
20844 some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and
20845 kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
20846 wail.  But this only the more affected some of them, because most
20847 mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising
20848 not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from
20849 the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
20850 peeringly uprising from the water alongside.  In the sea, under
20851 certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for
20852 men.
20853 
20854 But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
20855 confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning.  At
20856 sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
20857 and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for
20858 sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was
20859 thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may,
20860 he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a
20861 rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
20862 looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of
20863 the sea.
20864 
20865 The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where
20866 it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to
20867 seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had
20868 shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also
20869 filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed
20870 the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in
20871 sooth but a hard one.
20872 
20873 And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look
20874 out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own peculiar ground;
20875 that man was swallowed up in the deep.  But few, perhaps, thought of
20876 that at the time.  Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at
20877 this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a
20878 foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an
20879 evil already presaged.  They declared that now they knew the reason
20880 of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before.  But again the
20881 old Manxman said nay.
20882 
20883 The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to
20884 see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and
20885 as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
20886 the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was
20887 directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to
20888 be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided
20889 with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg
20890 hinted a hint concerning his coffin.
20891 
20892 "A life-buoy of a coffin!" cried Starbuck, starting.
20893 
20894 "Rather queer, that, I should say," said Stubb.
20895 
20896 "It will make a good enough one," said Flask, "the carpenter here can
20897 arrange it easily."
20898 
20899 "Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck, after a
20900 melancholy pause.  "Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--the
20901 coffin, I mean.  Dost thou hear me?  Rig it."
20902 
20903 "And shall I nail down the lid, sir?" moving his hand as with a
20904 hammer.
20905 
20906 "Aye."
20907 
20908 "And shall I caulk the seams, sir?" moving his hand as with a
20909 caulking-iron.
20910 
20911 "Aye."
20912 
20913 "And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?" moving his hand
20914 as with a pitch-pot.
20915 
20916 "Away! what possesses thee to this?  Make a life-buoy of the coffin,
20917 and no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me."
20918 
20919 "He goes off in a huff.  The whole he can endure; at the parts he
20920 baulks.  Now I don't like this.  I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and
20921 he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and
20922 he won't put his head into it.  Are all my pains to go for nothing
20923 with that coffin?  And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it.
20924 It's like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other
20925 side now.  I don't like this cobbling sort of business--I don't like
20926 it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place.  Let tinkers' brats
20927 do tinkerings; we are their betters.  I like to take in hand none but
20928 clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that
20929 regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway,
20930 and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, that's at
20931 an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end.  It's the old
20932 woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.  Lord! what an affection
20933 all old women have for tinkers.  I know an old woman of sixty-five
20934 who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once.  And that's the
20935 reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I
20936 kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their
20937 lonely old heads to run off with me.  But heigh-ho! there are no caps
20938 at sea but snow-caps.  Let me see.  Nail down the lid; caulk the
20939 seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang
20940 it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern.  Were ever such things
20941 done before with a coffin?  Some superstitious old carpenters, now,
20942 would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.  But I'm
20943 made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge.  Cruppered with a
20944 coffin!  Sailing about with a grave-yard tray!  But never mind.  We
20945 workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as
20946 coffins and hearses.  We work by the month, or by the job, or by the
20947 profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless
20948 it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can.  Hem!
20949 I'll do the job, now, tenderly.  I'll have me--let's see--how many in
20950 the ship's company, all told?  But I've forgotten.  Any way, I'll
20951 have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet
20952 long hanging all round to the coffin.  Then, if the hull go down,
20953 there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a
20954 sight not seen very often beneath the sun!  Come hammer,
20955 caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike!  Let's to it."

20963 
20964 THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE
20965 OPEN HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS; THE STRING OF
20966 TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE
20967 BOSOM OF HIS FROCK.--AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND
20968 HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM.
20969 
20970 
20971 Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently.  He goes!  Not this
20972 hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy.--Middle
20973 aisle of a church!  What's here?"
20974 
20975 "Life-buoy, sir.  Mr. Starbuck's orders.  Oh, look, sir!  Beware the
20976 hatchway!"
20977 
20978 "Thank ye, man.  Thy coffin lies handy to the vault."
20979 
20980 "Sir?  The hatchway? oh!  So it does, sir, so it does."
20981 
20982 "Art not thou the leg-maker?  Look, did not this stump come from thy
20983 shop?"
20984 
20985 "I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?"
20986 
20987 "Well enough.  But art thou not also the undertaker?"
20988 
20989 "Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
20990 they've set me now to turning it into something else."
20991 
20992 "Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
20993 monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and
20994 the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of
20995 those same coffins?  Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as
20996 much of a jack-of-all-trades."
20997 
20998 "But I do not mean anything, sir.  I do as I do."
20999 
21000 "The gods again.  Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
21001 coffin?  The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
21002 craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade
21003 in hand.  Dost thou never?"
21004 
21005 "Sing, sir?  Do I sing?  Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that;
21006 but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because
21007 there was none in his spade, sir.  But the caulking mallet is full of
21008 it.  Hark to it."
21009 
21010 "Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board; and what
21011 in all things makes the sounding-board is this--there's naught
21012 beneath.  And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the
21013 same, Carpenter.  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the
21014 coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?
21015 
21016 "Faith, sir, I've--"
21017 
21018 "Faith?  What's that?"
21019 
21020 "Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like--that's all,
21021 sir."
21022 
21023 "Um, um; go on."
21024 
21025 "I was about to say, sir, that--"
21026 
21027 "Art thou a silk-worm?  Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
21028 Look at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get these traps out of sight."
21029 
21030 "He goes aft.  That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
21031 latitudes.  I've heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
21032 Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle.  Seems to me
21033 some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle.
21034 He's always under the Line--fiery hot, I tell ye!  He's looking this
21035 way--come, oakum; quick.  Here we go again.  This wooden mallet is
21036 the cork, and I'm the professor of musical glasses--tap, tap!"
21037 
21038 (AHAB TO HIMSELF.)
21039 
21040 "There's a sight!  There's a sound!  The grey-headed woodpecker
21041 tapping the hollow tree!  Blind and dumb might well be envied now.
21042 See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines.  A most
21043 malicious wag, that fellow.  Rat-tat!  So man's seconds tick!  Oh!
21044 how immaterial are all materials!  What things real are there, but
21045 imponderable thoughts?  Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim
21046 death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope
21047 of most endangered life.  A life-buoy of a coffin!  Does it go
21048 further?  Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after
21049 all, but an immortality-preserver!  I'll think of that.  But no.  So
21050 far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the
21051 theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me.  Will ye
21052 never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound?  I go below;
21053 let me not see that thing here when I return again.  Now, then, Pip,
21054 we'll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee!
21055 Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!"

21058 
21059 CHAPTER 128
21060 
21061 The Pequod Meets The Rachel.
21062 
21063 
21064 Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly
21065 down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men.  At
21066 the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as
21067 the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful
21068 sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all
21069 life fled from the smitten hull.
21070 
21071 "Bad news; she brings bad news," muttered the old Manxman.  But ere
21072 her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere
21073 he could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.
21074 
21075 "Hast seen the White Whale?"
21076 
21077 "Aye, yesterday.  Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?"
21078 
21079 Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected
21080 question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the
21081 stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel's way, was seen
21082 descending her side.  A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon
21083 clinched the Pequod's main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.
21084 Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.  But
21085 no formal salutation was exchanged.
21086 
21087 "Where was he?--not killed!--not killed!" cried Ahab, closely
21088 advancing.  "How was it?"
21089 
21090 It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
21091 while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of
21092 whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
21093 while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and
21094 head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very
21095 far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat--a reserved
21096 one--had been instantly lowered in chase.  After a keen sail before
21097 the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to
21098 have succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the
21099 mast-head could tell anything about it.  In the distance he saw the
21100 diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white
21101 water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the
21102 stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as
21103 often happens.  There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm,
21104 as yet.  The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came
21105 on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats--ere going
21106 in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction--the
21107 ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate
21108 till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from
21109 it.  But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded
21110 all sail--stunsail on stunsail--after the missing boat; kindling a
21111 fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the
21112 look-out.  But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance
21113 to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though
21114 she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and
21115 not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered
21116 her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight;
21117 yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.
21118 
21119 The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal
21120 his object in boarding the Pequod.  He desired that ship to unite
21121 with his own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five
21122 miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as
21123 it were.
21124 
21125 "I will wager something now," whispered Stubb to Flask, "that some
21126 one in that missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap,
21127 his watch--he's so cursed anxious to get it back.  Who ever heard of
21128 two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the
21129 height of the whaling season?  See, Flask, only see how pale he
21130 looks--pale in the very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn't the
21131 coat--it must have been the--"
21132 
21133 "My boy, my own boy is among them.  For God's sake--I beg, I
21134 conjure"--here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far
21135 had but icily received his petition.  "For eight-and-forty hours let
21136 me charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for
21137 it--if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only
21138 that--you must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing."
21139 
21140 "His son!" cried Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's lost!  I take back the
21141 coat and watch--what says Ahab?  We must save that boy."
21142 
21143 "He's drowned with the rest on 'em, last night," said the old Manx
21144 sailor standing behind them; "I heard; all of ye heard their
21145 spirits."
21146 
21147 Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the
21148 Rachel's the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was
21149 one of the Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's
21150 crew; but among the number of the other boat's crews, at the same
21151 time, but on the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark
21152 vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as that
21153 for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the
21154 cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief
21155 mate's instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship
21156 in such emergencies, that is, when placed between jeopardized but
21157 divided boats, always to pick up the majority first.  But the
21158 captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from
21159 mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab's iciness did
21160 he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years
21161 old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a
21162 Nantucketer's paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in
21163 the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny
21164 of all his race.  Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket
21165 captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a
21166 protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than their
21167 own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall be
21168 unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely
21169 partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.
21170 
21171 Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of
21172 Ahab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but
21173 without the least quivering of his own.
21174 
21175 "I will not go," said the stranger, "till you say aye to me.  Do to
21176 me as you would have me do to you in the like case.  For YOU too have
21177 a boy, Captain Ahab--though but a child, and nestling safely at home
21178 now--a child of your old age too--Yes, yes, you relent; I see
21179 it--run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards."
21180 
21181 "Avast," cried Ahab--"touch not a rope-yarn"; then in a voice that
21182 prolongingly moulded every word--"Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
21183 Even now I lose time.  Good-bye, good-bye.  God bless ye, man, and
21184 may I forgive myself, but I must go.  Mr. Starbuck, look at the
21185 binnacle watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn
21186 off all strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail
21187 as before."
21188 
21189 Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
21190 leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and
21191 utter rejection of his so earnest suit.  But starting from his
21192 enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than
21193 stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.
21194 
21195 Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange
21196 vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every
21197 dark spot, however small, on the sea.  This way and that her yards
21198 were swung round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack;
21199 now she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it;
21200 while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with
21201 men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among
21202 the boughs.
21203 
21204 But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
21205 saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without
21206 comfort.  She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
21207 not.

21214 
21215 
21216 (AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)
21217 
21218 Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now.  The hour is
21219 coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have
21220 thee by him.  There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too
21221 curing to my malady.  Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady
21222 becomes my most desired health.  Do thou abide below here, where they
21223 shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain.  Aye, lad, thou shalt
21224 sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be."
21225 
21226 "No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
21227 your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I
21228 remain a part of ye."
21229 
21230 "Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
21231 fidelity of man!--and a black! and crazy!--but methinks
21232 like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again."
21233 
21234 "They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
21235 drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living
21236 skin.  But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him.  Sir, I
21237 must go with ye."
21238 
21239 "If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose keels up in
21240 him.  I tell thee no; it cannot be."
21241 
21242 "Oh good master, master, master!
21243 
21244 "Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
21245 Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and
21246 still know that I am there.  And now I quit thee.  Thy hand!--Met!
21247 True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre.  So: God for
21248 ever bless thee; and if it come to that,--God for ever save thee, let
21249 what will befall."
21250 
21251 (AHAB GOES; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD.)
21252 
21253 
21254 "Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,--but I'm alone.
21255 Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he's missing.
21256 Pip!  Pip!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip?  He must be up here;
21257 let's try the door.  What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet
21258 there's no opening it.  It must be the spell; he told me to stay
21259 here: Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine.  Here, then, I'll
21260 seat me, against the transom, in the ship's full middle, all her keel
21261 and her three masts before me.  Here, our old sailors say, in their
21262 black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord
21263 it over rows of captains and lieutenants.  Ha! what's this? epaulets!
21264 epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding!  Pass round the decanters;
21265 glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs!  What an odd feeling, now, when a
21266 black boy's host to white men with gold lace upon their
21267 coats!--Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?--a little negro lad, five
21268 feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!  Jumped from a whale-boat
21269 once;--seen him?  No!  Well then, fill up again, captains, and let's
21270 drink shame upon all cowards!  I name no names.  Shame upon them!
21271 Put one foot upon the table.  Shame upon all cowards.--Hist! above
21272 there, I hear ivory--Oh, master! master!  I am indeed down-hearted
21273 when you walk over me.  But here I'll stay, though this stern
21274 strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to join me."

21278 CHAPTER 130
21279 
21280 The Hat.
21281 
21282 
21283 And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
21284 preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--seemed to
21285 have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
21286 there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
21287 longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a
21288 vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
21289 encountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with
21290 various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac
21291 indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether
21292 sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something
21293 in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble
21294 souls to see.  As the unsetting polar star, which through the
21295 livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing, steady,
21296 central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the
21297 constant midnight of the gloomy crew.  It domineered above them so,
21298 that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide
21299 beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.
21300 
21301 In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
21302 vanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more
21303 strove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
21304 ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
21305 mortar of Ahab's iron soul.  Like machines, they dumbly moved about
21306 the deck, ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.
21307 
21308 But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours;
21309 when he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have
21310 seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable
21311 Parsee's glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at
21312 times affected it.  Such an added, gliding strangeness began to
21313 invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him;
21314 that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,
21315 whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow
21316 cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body.  And that shadow was
21317 always hovering there.  For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever
21318 certainly been known to slumber, or go below.  He would stand still
21319 for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did
21320 plainly say--We two watchmen never rest.
21321 
21322 Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon
21323 the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his
21324 pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating
21325 limits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing
21326 in the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if
21327 to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however
21328 motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that
21329 he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching
21330 hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes
21331 were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently
21332 scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a
21333 whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in
21334 beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.  The clothes that
21335 the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him; and so,
21336 day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the
21337 planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.
21338 
21339 He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast
21340 and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which
21341 darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,
21342 which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper
21343 verdure.  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;
21344 and though the Parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his
21345 own; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the
21346 other--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made
21347 it necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the
21348 twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like
21349 asunder.  If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb
21350 men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.
21351 At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far
21352 parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the
21353 mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
21354 Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his
21355 abandoned substance.
21356 
21357 And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
21358 and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab
21359 seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.  Still again
21360 both seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the
21361 lean shade siding the solid rib.  For be this Parsee what he may, all
21362 rib and keel was solid Ahab.
21363 
21364 At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was
21365 heard from aft,--"Man the mast-heads!"--and all through the day,
21366 till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at
21367 the striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard--"What d'ye
21368 see?--sharp! sharp!"
21369 
21370 But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
21371 children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the
21372 monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at
21373 least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to
21374 doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the
21375 sight he sought.  But if these suspicions were really his, he
21376 sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his
21377 actions might seem to hint them.
21378 
21379 "I will have the first sight of the whale myself,"--he said.  "Aye!
21380 Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest
21381 of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
21382 block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of
21383 the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a
21384 pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,
21385 with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked
21386 round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his
21387 glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;
21388 and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,
21389 said,--"Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck."
21390 Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to
21391 hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope
21392 at last; and afterwards stood near it.  And thus, with one hand
21393 clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for
21394 miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and that,--within the
21395 wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.
21396 
21397 When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
21398 the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea
21399 is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under
21400 these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in
21401 strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.
21402 Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various
21403 different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by
21404 what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these
21405 ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it
21406 would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant
21407 watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew
21408 be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's
21409 proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing
21410 about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who
21411 had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree
21412 approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the
21413 look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this
21414 was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his
21415 whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.
21416 
21417 Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
21418 minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
21419 incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
21420 latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his
21421 head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a
21422 thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,
21423 and went eddying again round his head.
21424 
21425 But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
21426 not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have
21427 marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost
21428 the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in
21429 almost every sight.
21430 
21431 "Your hat, your hat, sir!" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
21432 being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab,
21433 though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air
21434 dividing them.
21435 
21436 But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long
21437 hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away
21438 with his prize.
21439 
21440 An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to
21441 replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin
21442 would be king of Rome.  But only by the replacing of the cap was that
21443 omen accounted good.  Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk
21444 flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last
21445 disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute
21446 black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into
21447 the sea.
21448 
21449 
21450 
21451 CHAPTER 131
21452 
21453 The Pequod Meets The Delight.
21454 
21455 
21456 The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
21457 life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most
21458 miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried.  As she drew nigh, all
21459 eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
21460 whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
21461 feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
21462 
21463 Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
21464 some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but
21465 you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the
21466 peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
21467 
21468 "Hast seen the White Whale?"
21469 
21470 "Look!" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and
21471 with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
21472 
21473 "Hast killed him?"
21474 
21475 "The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that," answered the
21476 other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
21477 gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
21478 
21479 "Not forged!" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch,
21480 Ahab held it out, exclaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this
21481 hand I hold his death!  Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning
21482 are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place
21483 behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!"
21484 
21485 "Then God keep thee, old man--see'st thou that"--pointing to the
21486 hammock--"I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
21487 yesterday; but were dead ere night.  Only THAT one I bury; the rest
21488 were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb."  Then
21489 turning to his crew--"Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the
21490 rail, and lift the body; so, then--Oh!  God"--advancing towards the
21491 hammock with uplifted hands--"may the resurrection and the life--"
21492 
21493 "Brace forward!  Up helm!" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
21494 
21495 But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
21496 sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea;
21497 not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
21498 sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.
21499 
21500 As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
21501 hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.
21502 
21503 "Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!" cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
21504 "In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us
21505 your taffrail to show us your coffin!"
21506 
21507 
21508 
21509 CHAPTER 132
21510 
21511 The Symphony.
21512 
21513 
21514 It was a clear steel-blue day.  The firmaments of air and sea were
21515 hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air
21516 was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust
21517 and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as
21518 Samson's chest in his sleep.
21519 
21520 Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
21521 unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
21522 but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
21523 mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
21524 troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
21525 
21526 But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades
21527 and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it
21528 were, that distinguished them.
21529 
21530 Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
21531 air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom.  And at the
21532 girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen
21533 here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
21534 alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
21535 
21536 Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly
21537 firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in
21538 the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of
21539 the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's
21540 forehead of heaven.
21541 
21542 Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!  Invisible winged
21543 creatures that frolic all round us!  Sweet childhood of air and sky!
21544 how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe!  But so have I
21545 seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol
21546 around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which
21547 grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
21548 
21549 Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
21550 and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze,
21551 the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.  But
21552 the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel,
21553 for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.  That glad, happy air,
21554 that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother
21555 world, so long cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round
21556 his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over
21557 one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her
21558 heart to save and to bless.  From beneath his slouched hat Ahab
21559 dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such
21560 wealth as that one wee drop.
21561 
21562 Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the
21563 side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless
21564 sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around.  Careful
21565 not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and
21566 stood there.
21567 
21568 Ahab turned.
21569 
21570 "Starbuck!"
21571 
21572 "Sir."
21573 
21574 "Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.  On
21575 such a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first
21576 whale--a boy-harpooneer of eighteen!  Forty--forty--forty years
21577 ago!--ago!  Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of
21578 privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless
21579 sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty
21580 years to make war on the horrors of the deep!  Aye and yes, Starbuck,
21581 out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore.  When I think
21582 of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the
21583 masoned, walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but
21584 small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without--oh,
21585 weariness! heaviness!  Guinea-coast slavery of solitary
21586 command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so
21587 keenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon
21588 dry salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when
21589 the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and
21590 broken the world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole
21591 oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and
21592 sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my
21593 marriage pillow--wife? wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive!
21594 Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and
21595 then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking
21596 brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously,
21597 foamingly chased his prey--more a demon than a man!--aye, aye! what a
21598 forty years' fool--fool--old fool, has old Ahab been!  Why this
21599 strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the
21600 iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?  Behold.
21601 Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one
21602 poor leg should have been snatched from under me?  Here, brush this
21603 old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  Locks so grey did
21604 never grow but from out some ashes!  But do I look very old, so very,
21605 very old, Starbuck?  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as
21606 though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since
21607 Paradise.  God!  God!  God!--crack my heart!--stave my
21608 brain!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have
21609 I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably
21610 old?  Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human
21611 eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze
21612 upon God.  By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the
21613 magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.  No, no;
21614 stay on board, on board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab
21615 gives chase to Moby Dick.  That hazard shall not be thine.  No, no!
21616 not with the far away home I see in that eye!"
21617 
21618 "Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
21619 why should any one give chase to that hated fish!  Away with me! let
21620 us fly these deadly waters! let us home!  Wife and child, too, are
21621 Starbuck's--wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
21622 youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
21623 longing, paternal old age!  Away! let us away!--this instant let me
21624 alter the course!  How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would
21625 we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again!  I think, sir, they
21626 have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."
21627 
21628 "They have, they have.  I have seen them--some summer days in the
21629 morning.  About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy
21630 vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
21631 cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come
21632 back to dance him again."
21633 
21634 "'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!  She promised that my boy, every
21635 morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
21636 his father's sail!  Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
21637 Nantucket!  Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!
21638 See, see! the boy's face from the window! the boy's hand on the
21639 hill!"
21640 
21641 But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,
21642 and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
21643 
21644 "What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
21645 cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
21646 commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
21647 pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
21648 making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst
21649 not so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who, that
21650 lifts this arm?  But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an
21651 errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some
21652 invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one
21653 small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that
21654 thinking, does that living, and not I.  By heaven, man, we are turned
21655 round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the
21656 handspike.  And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this
21657 unsounded sea!  Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase
21658 and fang that flying-fish?  Where do murderers go, man!  Who's to
21659 doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?  But it is a
21660 mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as
21661 if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay
21662 somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are
21663 sleeping among the new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how we may,
21664 we all sleep at last on the field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust amid
21665 greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut
21666 swaths--Starbuck!"
21667 
21668 But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen
21669 away.
21670 
21671 Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
21672 two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there.  Fedallah was
21673 motionlessly leaning over the same rail.
21674 
21675 
21676 
21677 CHAPTER 133
21678 
21679 The Chase--First Day.
21680 
21681 
21682 That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at
21683 intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and
21684 went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,
21685 snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing
21686 nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.
21687 Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by
21688 the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any
21689 mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the
21690 dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as
21691 nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be
21692 slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.
21693 
21694 The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently
21695 vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea
21696 directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the
21697 pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like
21698 marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
21699 
21700 "Man the mast-heads!  Call all hands!"
21701 
21702 Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the
21703 forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps
21704 that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did
21705 they appear with their clothes in their hands.
21706 
21707 "What d'ye see?" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
21708 
21709 "Nothing, nothing sir!" was the sound hailing down in reply.
21710 
21711 "T'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!"
21712 
21713 All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
21714 swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they
21715 were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way
21716 aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between
21717 the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in
21718 the air.  "There she blows!--there she blows!  A hump like a
21719 snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!"
21720 
21721 Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
21722 look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
21723 whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final
21724 perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
21725 beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's
21726 head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the
21727 whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea
21728 revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent
21729 spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same
21730 silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and
21731 Indian Oceans.
21732 
21733 "And did none of ye see it before?" cried Ahab, hailing the perched
21734 men all around him.
21735 
21736 "I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and
21737 I cried out," said Tashtego.
21738 
21739 "Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
21740 reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised
21741 the White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there
21742 she blows!  There again!--there again!" he cried, in long-drawn,
21743 lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the
21744 whale's visible jets.  "He's going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down
21745 top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,
21746 stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!
21747 So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!
21748 All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.
21749 Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!" and he slid through the air
21750 to the deck.
21751 
21752 "He is heading straight to leeward, sir," cried Stubb, "right away
21753 from us; cannot have seen the ship yet."
21754 
21755 "Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard down the helm!--brace up!
21756 Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that!  Boats, boats!"
21757 
21758 Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails
21759 set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
21760 leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up
21761 Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
21762 
21763 Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the
21764 sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the
21765 ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;
21766 seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the
21767 breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his
21768 entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as
21769 if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of
21770 finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of
21771 the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft
21772 Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his
21773 broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the
21774 shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into
21775 the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright
21776 bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by
21777 the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,
21778 alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff
21779 rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered
21780 pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at
21781 intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and
21782 fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked
21783 on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.
21784 
21785 A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,
21786 invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away
21787 with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,
21788 leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching
21789 fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not
21790 Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White
21791 Whale as he so divinely swam.
21792 
21793 On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once
21794 leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale
21795 shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters
21796 who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had
21797 ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the
21798 vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou
21799 glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how
21800 many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed
21801 before.
21802 
21803 And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,
21804 among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,
21805 Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of
21806 his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his
21807 jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for
21808 an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like
21809 Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes
21810 in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of
21811 sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white
21812 sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.
21813 
21814 With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
21815 the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's
21816 reappearance.
21817 
21818 "An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he
21819 gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide
21820 wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his
21821 eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.
21822 The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.
21823 
21824 "The birds!--the birds!" cried Tashtego.
21825 
21826 In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were
21827 now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began
21828 fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with
21829 joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab
21830 could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down
21831 and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no
21832 bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and
21833 magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly
21834 revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating
21835 up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and
21836 scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the
21837 blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like
21838 an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his
21839 steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous
21840 apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,
21841 went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his
21842 crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.
21843 
21844 Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
21845 its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet
21846 under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with
21847 that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
21848 himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
21849 lengthwise beneath the boat.
21850 
21851 Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled
21852 for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner
21853 of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within
21854 his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high
21855 up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The
21856 bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of
21857 Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the
21858 White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her
21859 mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;
21860 but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to
21861 gain the uttermost stern.
21862 
21863 And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as
21864 the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and
21865 from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be
21866 darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as
21867 it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a
21868 quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac
21869 Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed
21870 him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with
21871 all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly
21872 strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,
21873 the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and
21874 snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,
21875 bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again
21876 in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated
21877 aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging
21878 to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them
21879 across.
21880 
21881 At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the
21882 first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his
21883 head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment
21884 his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.
21885 But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over
21886 sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;
21887 spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell
21888 flat-faced upon the sea.
21889 
21890 Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
21891 distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in
21892 the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled
21893 body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or
21894 more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their
21895 confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing
21896 their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the
21897 but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the
21898 Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.
21899 
21900 
21901 *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its
21902 designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary
21903 up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called
21904 pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must
21905 best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling
21906 him.
21907 
21908 
21909 But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly
21910 round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his
21911 vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more
21912 deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden
21913 him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's
21914 elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in
21915 the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to
21916 swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a
21917 whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed
21918 bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's
21919 fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the
21920 clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more
21921 than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so
21922 revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so
21923 planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he
21924 seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,
21925 unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the
21926 eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant
21927 destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that
21928 case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,
21929 then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose
21930 centre had now become the old man's head.
21931 
21932 Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the
21933 ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon
21934 the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed
21935 her!--"Sail on the"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him
21936 from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of
21937 it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he
21938 shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!"
21939 
21940 The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,
21941 she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he
21942 sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.
21943 
21944 Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white
21945 brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily
21946 strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for
21947 a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one
21948 trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails
21949 came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.
21950 
21951 But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the
21952 more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes
21953 condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains
21954 kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such
21955 hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods
21956 decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly
21957 made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless
21958 centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of
21959 inferior souls.
21960 
21961 "The harpoon," said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
21962 one bended arm--"is it safe?"
21963 
21964 "Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it," said Stubb, showing
21965 it.
21966 
21967 "Lay it before me;--any missing men?"
21968 
21969 "One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here
21970 are five men."
21971 
21972 "That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!
21973 there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands
21974 off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the
21975 sail; out oars; the helm!"
21976 
21977 It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being
21978 picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the
21979 chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It
21980 was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the
21981 added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his
21982 every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if
21983 now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an
21984 indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew
21985 endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining
21986 at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief
21987 vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered
21988 the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.
21989 Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to
21990 their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been
21991 previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,
21992 and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with
21993 stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod
21994 bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,
21995 methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly
21996 announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported
21997 as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the
21998 deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
21999 allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--"Whose is the doubloon
22000 now?  D'ye see him?" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he
22001 commanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore
22002 on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the
22003 planks.
22004 
22005 As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men
22006 aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to
22007 a still greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched
22008 hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been
22009 dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to
22010 shattered stern.  At last he paused before it; and as in an already
22011 over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,
22012 so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as
22013 this.
22014 
22015 Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
22016 evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place
22017 in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck
22018 exclaimed--"The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too
22019 keenly, sir; ha! ha!"
22020 
22021 "What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?  Man, man!
22022 did I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I
22023 could swear thou wert a poltroon.  Groan nor laugh should be heard
22024 before a wreck."
22025 
22026 "Aye, sir," said Starbuck drawing near, "'tis a solemn sight; an
22027 omen, and an ill one."
22028 
22029 "Omen? omen?--the dictionary!  If the gods think to speak outright to
22030 man, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
22031 give an old wives' darkling hint.--Begone!  Ye two are the opposite
22032 poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is
22033 Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the
22034 millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors!  Cold,
22035 cold--I shiver!--How now?  Aloft there!  D'ye see him?  Sing out for
22036 every spout, though he spout ten times a second!"
22037 
22038 The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was
22039 rustling.  Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still
22040 remained unset.
22041 
22042 "Can't see the spout now, sir;--too dark"--cried a voice from the
22043 air.
22044 
22045 "How heading when last seen?"
22046 
22047 "As before, sir,--straight to leeward."
22048 
22049 "Good! he will travel slower now 'tis night.  Down royals and
22050 top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck.  We must not run over him
22051 before morning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a while.
22052 Helm there! keep her full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--Mr.
22053 Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned
22054 till morning."--Then advancing towards the doubloon in the
22055 main-mast--"Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let
22056 it abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye
22057 first raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that
22058 man's; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times
22059 its sum shall be divided among all of ye!  Away now!--the deck is
22060 thine, sir!"
22061 
22062 And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
22063 slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
22064 rousing himself to see how the night wore on.
22065

22068 CHAPTER 134
22069 
22070 The Chase--Second Day.
22071 
22072 
22073 At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
22074 
22075 "D'ye see him?" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the
22076 light to spread.
22077 
22078 "See nothing, sir."
22079 
22080 "Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
22081 for;--the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her
22082 all night.  But no matter--'tis but resting for the rush."
22083 
22084 Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
22085 whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day,
22086 is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery.  For
22087 such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
22088 confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the
22089 Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale
22090 when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances,
22091 pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will
22092 continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his
22093 probable rate of progression during that period.  And, in these
22094 cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose
22095 general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to
22096 return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands
22097 by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present
22098 visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen
22099 headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his
22100 compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently
22101 marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures
22102 the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost
22103 as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's
22104 coast is to him.  So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the
22105 proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all
22106 desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.  And as
22107 the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly
22108 known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time
22109 his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it,
22110 the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at
22111 such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these
22112 Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the
22113 observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours
22114 hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about
22115 reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.  But to render
22116 this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea
22117 must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the
22118 becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
22119 exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port?  Inferable
22120 from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching
22121 the chase of whales.
22122 
22123 The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
22124 cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
22125 field.
22126 
22127 "By salt and hemp!" cried Stubb, "but this swift motion of the deck
22128 creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart.  This ship and I are
22129 two brave fellows!--Ha, ha!  Some one take me up, and launch me,
22130 spine-wise, on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel.  Ha,
22131 ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!"
22132 
22133 "There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!" was now the
22134 mast-head cry.
22135 
22136 "Aye, aye!" cried Stubb, "I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and
22137 split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
22138 your trump--blister your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a
22139 miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!"
22140 
22141 And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.  The
22142 frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up,
22143 like old wine worked anew.  Whatever pale fears and forebodings some
22144 of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of
22145 sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and
22146 on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the
22147 bounding bison.  The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and
22148 by the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past
22149 night's suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which
22150 their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these
22151 things, their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great
22152 bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as
22153 irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so
22154 enslaved them to the race.
22155 
22156 They were one man, not thirty.  For as the one ship that held them
22157 all; though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and
22158 maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran
22159 into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both
22160 balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the
22161 individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt
22162 and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all
22163 directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did
22164 point to.
22165 
22166 The rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
22167 outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs.  Clinging to a spar with
22168 one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings;
22169 others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on
22170 the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready
22171 and ripe for their fate.  Ah! how they still strove through that
22172 infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!
22173 
22174 "Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?" cried Ahab, when, after
22175 the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been
22176 heard.  "Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts
22177 one odd jet that way, and then disappears."
22178 
22179 It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken
22180 some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon
22181 proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope
22182 belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an
22183 orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges
22184 of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,
22185 as--much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less
22186 than a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!  For not by any
22187 calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic
22188 fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;
22189 but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with
22190 his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus
22191 booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a
22192 mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven
22193 miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes
22194 off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of
22195 defiance.
22196 
22197 "There she breaches! there she breaches!" was the cry, as in his
22198 immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
22199 Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
22200 against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
22201 for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
22202 stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
22203 intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
22204 
22205 "Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy hour
22206 and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at
22207 the fore.  The boats!--stand by!"
22208 
22209 Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
22210 shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
22211 halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped
22212 from his perch.
22213 
22214 "Lower away," he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare
22215 one, rigged the afternoon previous.  "Mr. Starbuck, the ship is
22216 thine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!"
22217 
22218 As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the
22219 first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for
22220 the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he
22221 told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull
22222 straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a
22223 certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the
22224 whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and
22225 while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his
22226 eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in
22227 an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a
22228 lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of
22229 the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on
22230 annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But
22231 skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in
22232 the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by
22233 a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore
22234 every other cry but his to shreds.
22235 
22236 But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
22237 and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the
22238 three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of
22239 themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in
22240 him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to
22241 rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab
22242 first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking
22243 in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some
22244 snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of
22245 sharks!
22246 
22247 Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
22248 harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
22249 flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.
22250 Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically
22251 reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;
22252 dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and
22253 then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the
22254 intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.
22255 That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining
22256 tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the
22257 more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed
22258 them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and
22259 then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,
22260 in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced
22261 round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of
22262 punch.
22263 
22264 While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out
22265 after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,
22266 while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,
22267 twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and
22268 Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while
22269 the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the
22270 creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness
22271 of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed
22272 drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting
22273 perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad
22274 forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into
22275 the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men
22276 struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.
22277 
22278 The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as
22279 he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a
22280 little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and
22281 with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his
22282 flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the
22283 least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly
22284 drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if
22285 satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated
22286 forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled
22287 lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.
22288 
22289 As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
22290 came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
22291 floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,
22292 and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,
22293 wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
22294 inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all
22295 these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have
22296 befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now
22297 found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a
22298 comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous
22299 day's mishap.
22300 
22301 But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;
22302 as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the
22303 shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist
22304 him.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp
22305 splinter.
22306 
22307 "Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who
22308 he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has."
22309 
22310 "The ferrule has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up;
22311 "I put good work into that leg."
22312 
22313 "But no bones broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.
22314 
22315 "Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even
22316 with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living
22317 bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost.  Nor
22318 white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his
22319 own proper and inaccessible being.  Can any lead touch yonder floor,
22320 any mast scrape yonder roof?--Aloft there! which way?"
22321 
22322 "Dead to leeward, sir."
22323 
22324 "Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest
22325 of the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the
22326 boat's crews."
22327 
22328 "Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir."
22329 
22330 "Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!  Accursed fate! that the
22331 unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!"
22332 
22333 "Sir?"
22334 
22335 "My body, man, not thee.  Give me something for a cane--there, that
22336 shivered lance will do.  Muster the men.  Surely I have not seen him
22337 yet.  By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all."
22338 
22339 The old man's hinted thought was true.  Upon mustering the company,
22340 the Parsee was not there.
22341 
22342 "The Parsee!" cried Stubb--"he must have been caught in--"
22343 
22344 "The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
22345 forecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!"
22346 
22347 But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
22348 nowhere to be found.
22349 
22350 "Aye, sir," said Stubb--"caught among the tangles of your line--I
22351 thought I saw him dragging under."
22352 
22353 "MY line! MY line?  Gone?--gone?  What means that little word?--What
22354 death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the
22355 belfry.  The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--d'ye see
22356 it?--the forged iron, men, the white whale's--no, no, no,--blistered
22357 fool! this hand did dart it!--'tis in the fish!--Aloft there!  Keep
22358 him nailed--Quick!--all hands to the rigging of the boats--collect
22359 the oars--harpooneers! the irons, the irons!--hoist the royals higher--a
22360 pull on all the sheets!--helm there! steady, steady for your life!
22361 I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight
22362 through it, but I'll slay him yet!
22363 
22364 "Great God! but for one single instant show thyself," cried Starbuck;
22365 "never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--In Jesus' name no more
22366 of this, that's worse than devil's madness.  Two days chased; twice
22367 stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee;
22368 thy evil shadow gone--all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:--
22369 what more wouldst thou have?--Shall we keep chasing this murderous
22370 fish till he swamps the last man?  Shall we be dragged by him to the
22371 bottom of the sea?  Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?
22372 Oh, oh,--Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!"
22373 
22374 "Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
22375 hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes.  But in
22376 this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm
22377 of this hand--a lipless, unfeatured blank.  Ahab is for ever Ahab,
22378 man.  This whole act's immutably decreed.  'Twas rehearsed by thee
22379 and me a billion years before this ocean rolled.  Fool!  I am the
22380 Fates' lieutenant; I act under orders.  Look thou, underling! that
22381 thou obeyest mine.--Stand round me, men.  Ye see an old man cut down
22382 to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely
22383 foot.  'Tis Ahab--his body's part; but Ahab's soul's a centipede,
22384 that moves upon a hundred legs.  I feel strained, half stranded, as
22385 ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so.  But
22386 ere I break, yell hear me crack; and till ye hear THAT, know that
22387 Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet.  Believe ye, men, in the things
22388 called omens?  Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!  For ere they drown,
22389 drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to
22390 sink for evermore.  So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--tomorrow
22391 will be the third.  Aye, men, he'll rise once more,--but only to
22392 spout his last!  D'ye feel brave men, brave?"
22393 
22394 "As fearless fire," cried Stubb.
22395 
22396 "And as mechanical," muttered Ahab.  Then as the men went forward, he
22397 muttered on: "The things called omens!  And yesterday I talked the
22398 same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.  Oh! how valiantly
22399 I seek to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in
22400 mine!--The Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go
22401 before:--but still was to be seen again ere I could perish--How's
22402 that?--There's a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by
22403 the ghosts of the whole line of judges:--like a hawk's beak it pecks
22404 my brain.  I'LL, I'LL solve it, though!"
22405 
22406 When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
22407 
22408 So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as
22409 on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
22410 grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by
22411 lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and
22412 sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow.  Meantime, of the
22413 broken keel of Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another
22414 leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed
22415 within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone
22416 backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.
22417

22420 CHAPTER 135
22421 
22422 The Chase.--Third Day.
22423 
22424 
22425 The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
22426 solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of
22427 the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
22428 
22429 "D'ye see him?" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
22430 
22431 "In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all.
22432 Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.  What a
22433 lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a
22434 summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its
22435 throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.
22436 Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never
22437 thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; THAT'S tingling enough for
22438 mortal man! to think's audacity.  God only has that right and
22439 privilege.  Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness;
22440 and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for
22441 that.  And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen
22442 calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents
22443 turned to ice, and shiver it.  And still this hair is growing now;
22444 this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's like that
22445 sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
22446 clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.  How the wild winds blow
22447 it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the
22448 tossed ship they cling to.  A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere
22449 this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
22450 ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
22451 Out upon it!--it's tainted.  Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on
22452 such a wicked, miserable world.  I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and
22453 slink there.  And yet, 'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who
22454 ever conquered it?  In every fight it has the last and bitterest
22455 blow.  Run tilting at it, and you but run through it.  Ha! a coward
22456 wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a
22457 single blow.  Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler thing than THAT.
22458 Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most
22459 exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but
22460 only bodiless as objects, not as agents.  There's a most special, a
22461 most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference!  And yet, I say again,
22462 and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and gracious in
22463 the wind.  These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear
22464 heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness;
22465 and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea
22466 may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and
22467 swerve about, uncertain where to go at last.  And by the eternal
22468 Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these
22469 Trades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full
22470 as strong, blow my keeled soul along!  To it!  Aloft there!  What
22471 d'ye see?"
22472 
22473 "Nothing, sir."
22474 
22475 "Nothing! and noon at hand!  The doubloon goes a-begging!  See the
22476 sun!  Aye, aye, it must be so.  I've oversailed him.  How, got the
22477 start?  Aye, he's chasing ME now; not I, HIM--that's bad; I might
22478 have known it, too.  Fool! the lines--the harpoons he's towing.  Aye,
22479 aye, I have run him by last night.  About! about!  Come down, all of
22480 ye, but the regular look outs!  Man the braces!"
22481 
22482 Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's
22483 quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the
22484 braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in
22485 her own white wake.
22486 
22487 "Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw," murmured Starbuck
22488 to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail.
22489 "God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the
22490 inside wet my flesh.  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying
22491 him!"
22492 
22493 "Stand by to sway me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
22494 "We should meet him soon."
22495 
22496 "Aye, aye, sir," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and
22497 once more Ahab swung on high.
22498 
22499 A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages.  Time itself now
22500 held long breaths with keen suspense.  But at last, some three points
22501 off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly
22502 from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of
22503 fire had voiced it.
22504 
22505 "Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick!  On
22506 deck there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind's eye.  He's
22507 too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.  The sails shake!  Stand over
22508 that helmsman with a top-maul!  So, so; he travels fast, and I must
22509 down.  But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the
22510 sea; there's time for that.  An old, old sight, and yet somehow so
22511 young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from
22512 the sand-hills of Nantucket!  The same!--the same!--the same to Noah
22513 as to me.  There's a soft shower to leeward.  Such lovely
22514 leewardings!  They must lead somewhere--to something else than common
22515 land, more palmy than the palms.  Leeward! the white whale goes that
22516 way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter.  But
22517 good bye, good bye, old mast-head!  What's this?--green? aye, tiny
22518 mosses in these warped cracks.  No such green weather stains on
22519 Ahab's head!  There's the difference now between man's old age and
22520 matter's.  But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our
22521 hulls, though, are we not, my ship?  Aye, minus a leg, that's all.
22522 By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.
22523 I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships made of dead trees
22524 outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital
22525 fathers.  What's that he said? he should still go before me, my
22526 pilot; and yet to be seen again?  But where?  Will I have eyes at the
22527 bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all
22528 night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.  Aye, aye,
22529 like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O
22530 Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.  Good-bye,
22531 mast-head--keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone.  We'll
22532 talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there,
22533 tied by head and tail."
22534 
22535 He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
22536 through the cloven blue air to the deck.
22537 
22538 In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop's
22539 stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to
22540 the mate,--who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck--and bade him
22541 pause.
22542 
22543 "Starbuck!"
22544 
22545 "Sir?"
22546 
22547 "For the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage,
22548 Starbuck."
22549 
22550 "Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so."
22551 
22552 "Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
22553 Starbuck!"
22554 
22555 "Truth, sir: saddest truth."
22556 
22557 "Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
22558 flood;--and I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb,
22559 Starbuck.  I am old;--shake hands with me, man."
22560 
22561 Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.
22562 
22563 "Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it's
22564 a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!"
22565 
22566 "Lower away!"--cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him.  "Stand
22567 by the crew!"
22568 
22569 In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
22570 
22571 "The sharks! the sharks!" cried a voice from the low cabin-window
22572 there; "O master, my master, come back!"
22573 
22574 But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and
22575 the boat leaped on.
22576 
22577 Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship,
22578 when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters
22579 beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars,
22580 every time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the
22581 boat with their bites.  It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the
22582 whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently
22583 following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the
22584 banners of marching regiments in the east.  But these were the first
22585 sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had
22586 been first descried; and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all
22587 such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to
22588 the senses of the sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect
22589 them,--however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without
22590 molesting the others.
22591 
22592 "Heart of wrought steel!" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
22593 following with his eyes the receding boat--"canst thou yet ring
22594 boldly to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and
22595 followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical
22596 third day?--For when three days flow together in one continuous
22597 intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the
22598 noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing--be that
22599 end what it may.  Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me,
22600 and leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,--fixed at the top of a
22601 shudder!  Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and
22602 skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.  Mary, girl! thou
22603 fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!  I seem to see but thy eyes
22604 grown wondrous blue.  Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but
22605 clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming?  My legs feel
22606 faint; like his who has footed it all day.  Feel thy heart,--beats
22607 it yet?  Stir thyself, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move! speak
22608 aloud!--Mast-head there!  See ye my boy's hand on the
22609 hill?--Crazed;--aloft there!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--
22610 mark well the whale!--Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he
22611 pecks--he tears the vane"--pointing to the red flag flying at the
22612 main-truck--"Ha! he soars away with it!--Where's the old man now?
22613 see'st thou that sight, oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!"
22614 
22615 The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the
22616 mast-heads--a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had
22617 sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on
22618 his way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew
22619 maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered
22620 and hammered against the opposing bow.
22621 
22622 "Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
22623 drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
22624 no hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can kill me!  Ha! ha!"
22625 
22626 Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
22627 quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
22628 ice, swiftly rising to the surface.  A low rumbling sound was heard;
22629 a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled
22630 with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot
22631 lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping
22632 veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then
22633 fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the
22634 waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly
22635 sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like
22636 new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.
22637 
22638 "Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward
22639 to the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded
22640 in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that
22641 fell from heaven.  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his
22642 broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted
22643 together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and
22644 once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from
22645 the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of
22646 their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.
22647 
22648 While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as
22649 the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank
22650 as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up.  Lashed
22651 round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns
22652 in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions
22653 of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;
22654 his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full
22655 upon old Ahab.
22656 
22657 The harpoon dropped from his hand.
22658 
22659 "Befooled, befooled!"--drawing in a long lean breath--"Aye, Parsee!
22660 I see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, THIS then is
22661 the hearse that thou didst promise.  But I hold thee to the last
22662 letter of thy word.  Where is the second hearse?  Away, mates, to the
22663 ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and
22664 return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first
22665 thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I
22666 harpoon.  Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey
22667 me.--Where's the whale? gone down again?"
22668 
22669 But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with
22670 the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last
22671 encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was
22672 now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the
22673 ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to
22674 him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.  He seemed
22675 swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing
22676 his own straight path in the sea.
22677 
22678 "Oh!  Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now, the third
22679 day, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks thee not.  It is thou, thou,
22680 that madly seekest him!"
22681 
22682 Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
22683 to leeward, by both oars and canvas.  And at last when Ahab was
22684 sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's
22685 face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel
22686 about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.
22687 Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly
22688 mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in
22689 the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and
22690 were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through
22691 the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb
22692 and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and
22693 lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken
22694 boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But
22695 he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the
22696 main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that
22697 perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and
22698 so nail it to the mast.
22699 
22700 Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance
22701 to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
22702 latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
22703 Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so
22704 rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start
22705 had not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over
22706 the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously
22707 stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that
22708 the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in
22709 the sea, at almost every dip.
22710 
22711 "Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull
22712 on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water."
22713 
22714 "But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!"
22715 
22716 "They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell"--he
22717 muttered--"whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
22718 Ahab?--But pull on!  Aye, all alive, now--we near him.  The helm!
22719 take the helm! let me pass,"--and so saying two of the oarsmen helped
22720 him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.
22721 
22722 At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along
22723 with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
22724 advance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab was fairly within the
22725 smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled
22726 round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
22727 with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
22728 poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
22729 hated whale.  As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if
22730 sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically
22731 rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in
22732 it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the
22733 elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once
22734 more have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the
22735 oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were
22736 therefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so
22737 fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and
22738 rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily
22739 inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still
22740 afloat and swimming.
22741 
22742 Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
22743 instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
22744 sea.  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
22745 the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on
22746 their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the
22747 treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the
22748 empty air!
22749 
22750 "What breaks in me?  Some sinew cracks!--'tis whole again; oars!
22751 oars!  Burst in upon him!"
22752 
22753 Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale
22754 wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that
22755 evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;
22756 seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking
22757 it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down
22758 upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
22759 
22760 Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead.  "I grow blind; hands!
22761 stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.  Is't night?"
22762 
22763 "The whale!  The ship!" cried the cringing oarsmen.
22764 
22765 "Oars! oars!  Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be
22766 for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his
22767 mark!  I see: the ship! the ship!  Dash on, my men!  Will ye not
22768 save my ship?"
22769 
22770 But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
22771 sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two
22772 planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily
22773 disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading,
22774 splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring
22775 water.
22776 
22777 Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer
22778 remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him
22779 as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his
22780 own forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon
22781 the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as
22782 soon as he.
22783 
22784 "The whale, the whale!  Up helm, up helm!  Oh, all ye sweet powers of
22785 air, now hug me close!  Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
22786 woman's fainting fit.  Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw!
22787 Is this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long
22788 fidelities?  Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work.  Steady! helmsman, steady.
22789 Nay, nay!  Up helm again!  He turns to meet us!  Oh, his
22790 unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he
22791 cannot depart.  My God, stand by me now!"
22792 
22793 "Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
22794 help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here.  I grin at thee, thou
22795 grinning whale!  Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but
22796 Stubb's own unwinking eye?  And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a
22797 mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!
22798 I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!  Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!
22799 I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.
22800 For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand
22801 the cup!  Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there'll be plenty
22802 of gulping soon!  Why fly ye not, O Ahab!  For me, off shoes and
22803 jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers!  A most mouldy and over
22804 salted death, though;--cherries! cherries! cherries!  Oh, Flask, for
22805 one red cherry ere we die!"
22806 
22807 "Cherries?  I only wish that we were where they grow.  Oh, Stubb, I
22808 hope my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers
22809 will now come to her, for the voyage is up."
22810 
22811 From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;
22812 hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained
22813 in their hands, just as they had darted from their various
22814 employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which
22815 from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a
22816 broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he
22817 rushed.  Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his
22818 whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid
22819 white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's starboard bow, till
22820 men and timbers reeled.  Some fell flat upon their faces.  Like
22821 dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their
22822 bull-like necks.  Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as
22823 mountain torrents down a flume.
22824 
22825 "The ship!  The hearse!--the second hearse!" cried Ahab from the
22826 boat; "its wood could only be American!"
22827 
22828 Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
22829 keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
22830 off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for
22831 a time, he lay quiescent.
22832 
22833 "I turn my body from the sun.  What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
22834 hammer.  Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked
22835 keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm,
22836 and Pole-pointed prow,--death-glorious ship! must ye then perish,
22837 and without me?  Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest
22838 shipwrecked captains?  Oh, lonely death on lonely life!  Oh, now I
22839 feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief.  Ho, ho! from all
22840 your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole
22841 foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death!  Towards
22842 thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last
22843 I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's
22844 sake I spit my last breath at thee.  Sink all coffins and all hearses
22845 to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to
22846 pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned
22847 whale!  THUS, I give up the spear!"
22848 
22849 The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with
22850 igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves;--ran foul.  Ahab
22851 stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him
22852 round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their
22853 victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.
22854 Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out
22855 of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea,
22856 disappeared in its depths.
22857 
22858 For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned.
22859 "The ship?  Great God, where is the ship?"  Soon they through dim,
22860 bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the
22861 gaseous Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while
22862 fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty
22863 perches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking
22864 lookouts on the sea.  And now, concentric circles seized the lone
22865 boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every
22866 lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round
22867 in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.
22868 
22869 But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
22870 sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of
22871 the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the
22872 flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the
22873 destroying billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm
22874 and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act
22875 of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.  A
22876 sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from
22877 its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and
22878 incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its
22879 broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and
22880 simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage
22881 beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the
22882 bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak
22883 thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of
22884 Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to
22885 hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and
22886 helmeted herself with it.
22887 
22888 Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
22889 white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
22890 great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years
22891 ago.

22897 "AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE"
22898 Job.
22899 
22900 The drama's done.  Why then here does any one step forth?--Because
22901 one did survive the wreck.
22902 
22903 It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was he whom
22904 the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman, when that
22905 bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day
22906 the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped
22907 astern.  So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full
22908 sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me,
22909 I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex.  When I
22910 reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool.  Round and round, then,
22911 and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis
22912 of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.
22913 Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and
22914 now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its
22915 great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot
22916 lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.  Buoyed
22917 up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a
22918 soft and dirgelike main.  The unharming sharks, they glided by as if
22919 with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with
22920 sheathed beaks.  On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and
22921 picked me up at last.  It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in
22922 her retracing search after her missing children, only found another
22923 orphan.
