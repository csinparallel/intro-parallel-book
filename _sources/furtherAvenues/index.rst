CHAPTER 4: Further Avenues of Exploration
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Several of the sample problems we have discussed this far have been embarassingly parallel. 

Computations are largely independent of each other. 

Introduce the notion of a dependency, and how dependenecies can limit the amount of parallelism inherent in a program. 

In this chapter, we cover common algorithmic patterns and their parallel implementations to show readers what 
strategies to use when parallelizing more complex tasks.
