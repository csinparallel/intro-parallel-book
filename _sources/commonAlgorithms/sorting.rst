3.1 Sorting
-------------

Discuss at a high level what the problem of sorting is. Unplugged activity for 
non-deterministic sorting. The point is that all sorting algorithms are a 
specification of a non-deterministic process. We cover one: odd-even transposition sort. 

Discuss the activity (maybe show a TSGL visualization). 

Now walk students through implementations in code in OpenMP and MPI
