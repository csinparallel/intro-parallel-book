3.4 Shared Queue
-----------------

Discuss at a high level what a shared queue is and what it is used for. 
Mention that it is used to implement message processing in the multiprocessing package in Python.

We need an unplugged activity associated with this, but will use that to explain how a shared queue works. 

Next, walk students through an implementation of one in OpenMP/MPI, where the goal is to have multiple 
processes/threads access a shared queue.
