3.5 Matrix Multiplication
--------------------------

The base data structure we have used thsu far in all of our examples have been arrays. 
However, parallelism can be used for more complex data structures, such as data structures or graphs.

Talk about the problem of matrix multiplication, and go through unplugged activity.

Then show how to implement the algorithm in OpenMP/MPI. 

Point out that while we don't cover graph algorithms in this book, adjaceny matrices are commonly used to represent graphs.
