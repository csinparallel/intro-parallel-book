2.1 First Steps - Programming with Message Passing
---------------------------------------------------

Introduce MPI as a standard for message passing. Start with MPI patternlets for SPMD and master worker. 

Also talk about how data can be split amongst many processes. 

Introduce Send and Receive and show a naieve implementation of integration using MPI. Show how 
the send and receive can be used to send an array of values and calculate the sum. 

May also want to talk about dealing with race conditions.
