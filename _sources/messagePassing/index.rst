CHAPTER 2: Message Passing
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Brief review of what message passing means and what it is used for. Talk about process and inter-process communication, and how this is the 
main way communication occurs in distributed memory architectures, but is general enough to also work on shared memory architectures.

Give some practical "real world" examples of inter-process communication that students may have interacted with: instant messaging, web searches, etc.

Ensure that students understand that interprocess communication can occur on a single machine or enable communication between multiple machines. 
Define terms such as node, core, cluster compute, peer-to-peer, and process.

Re-introduce the jigsaw puzzle analogy and discuss the distributed memory/process communication use case.
