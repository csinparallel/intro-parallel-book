2.2 Improving the Example
--------------------------

Update the array addition example using scatter() method and 
introduce the gather() and reduce() functions.

Have students choose which one makes more sense gather() or reduce().

Then have them modify the program with reduce() and gather().

Have them time the performance of the two implementations.
