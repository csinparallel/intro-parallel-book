1.4 Performance Concerns
---------------------------------

Have students increase the number of threads (keep data constant), and see if their speedup stays linear.

After a while, the speedup goes down.

Return to the jigsaw puzzle analogy. remind studetns of the case when there are too many people and not enough pieces,
communication overhead slows everything down. 

Another way Amdahl's Law comes into effect is when there is a large serial component. 

Using puzzles again as an analogy (one person does one large component, other people work on smaller component). 

Have students use the array addition example and scale up the array size while keeping the processor counts contant. 
Have them recalculate speedup and efficiency. 

Introduce the notion of load balancing, and how smart strategies can help reduce performance bottlenecks.
