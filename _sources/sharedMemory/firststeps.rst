1.1 First Steps - Programming Shared Memory
-------------------------------------------

Introduce OpenMP as one of many languages for programming shared memory systems. 

Walk through fork-join patternlet and use output to motivate a discussion of thread execution and 
to define non-determinism.

Introduce the SPMD patternlet, and define what single program multiple data is, and how it relates 
to the notion of data parallelism. As an example, 
discuss the process of array addition (sample unplugged activity). 

Contrast "task parallelism" with "data parallelism" and mention how most parallel programs are 
somewhere along the spectrum. Recognize that both strategies are ways to assign work to threads.
