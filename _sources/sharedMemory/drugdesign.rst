1.5 Real World Problem - Drug Design
-------------------------------------


Let's look at a larger example....


Go through drug design exemplar, and use it to introduce the difference between static scheduling and dynamic scheduling. 
Should point out that the two programs that students have played with thus far the work was statically scheduled. 

Talk about why in the drug design example, dynamic scheduling is better. 

Have students time performance of the code on the static and dynamic test cases, and measure their results.
