Contributing
--------------------

Have an idea for an interesting section to *PDC for Beginners*? We welcome 
section contributors to Chapters 3 and 4 of this book. Specifically we 
are interested in guest authors for the following sections in Chapter 3:

* Sorting 
* Matrix Multiplication


Sections should be designed to be completed by a student reader in approximately 
90 minutes or less. We highly encourage interactive elements, such as videos, 
animations, and coding problems. 

All sections must: 

* have a high-level explanation of the problem. We encourage you to use analogies or visualizations. See `PDC Unplugged <https://www.pdcunplugged.org/>`_ for ideas.

* Have a solution to the problem in MPI and OpenMP.

* contain interactive elements.

If you are interested in contributing, please e-mail csinparallel@stolaf.edu 
with a rough draft of your section, and some ideas for making it interactive.
