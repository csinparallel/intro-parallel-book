5.0 Introduction
----------------

In many ways, the progress of Artificial Intelligence research can be measured
through the history of human-competitive game play.  In 1994, an AI called "Chinook"
defeated checkers champion Marion Tinsley. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated
Gary Kasparov in a six-game match.  In 2017, AlphaGo defeated Ke Jie, the world's 
top-ranked Go player, earning the rank of 9 dan.  

At the heart of these AI milestones is a simple algorithm called Minimax that dates
back to John von Neumann (1928), although Claude Shannon (1950) is often given credit
for recognizing its applications to games like chess.

Minimax is an optimal strategy for deterministic two-player zero-sum games of perfect information.  
"Deterministic" means that there are no random events like dice that determine the state of the game.
"Zero-sum" means that there is only one winner (that is, both players final scores add up to zero).  
"Perfect Information" means that both players can see all the pieces in play (like chess or checkers), 
rather than keeping some information secret (like poker).
